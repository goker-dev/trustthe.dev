Art Style:
Use the Ancient Egyptian art style characterized by figures depicted in composite view — head and limbs shown in profile, eye and torso shown frontally. Apply strong, clear outlines around figures and objects, and fill enclosed areas with flat, solid colors without shading or blending. Utilize a limited earth-based color palette including Red Ochre, Yellow Ochre, Carbon Black, Gypsum White, Egyptian Blue, and Malachite Green. Arrange figures formally along horizontal baselines, often organized into registers (horizontal bands) to structure the scene. Prioritize clarity, symbolism, and conceptual space, avoiding realistic depth, shading, or perspective.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting, avoiding any depiction of shadows or light sources. Maintain a direct, straight-on view that emphasizes the two-dimensional, stylized nature of the composition. Figures should conform to the composite view convention, arranged along baselines or within structured registers. The setting should simulate an Ancient Egyptian decorated surface such as a tomb wall, temple wall, or papyrus scroll, potentially featuring stylized environmental motifs like papyrus reeds or geometric Egyptian framing patterns.
