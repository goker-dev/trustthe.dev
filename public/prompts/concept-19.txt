Concept: 
Visualize the dynamic sensation of speed and movement, perhaps depicting a speeding car, train, or cyclist using fragmented forms, rhythmic repetition, and "lines of force" that suggest motion blur and trajectory. Embrace themes of technology, urban energy, and the machine age. Use bright, vibrant colors and compositions that convey dynamism, energy, and the simultaneous experiences of modern life.

Emotion target: 
Evoke feelings of excitement, energy, dynamism, speed, and the power of technology. Celebrate the sensory overload and relentless motion of the modern world. Aim to capture the thrill, sometimes bordering on aggression or violence, associated with machines, urban life, and a radical break from the past.
