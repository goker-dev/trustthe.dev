Art Style:
Use the Realism style characterized by accurate, objective, and unidealized depictions of everyday life and ordinary subjects. Focus on direct observation and truthfulness to reality, portraying figures honestly with visible signs of labor, age, or social class. Avoid historical, mythological, exotic, or overly sentimental themes. Employ naturalistic, often somber or earthy color palettes featuring browns, greys, muted greens, dull blues, realistic flesh tones, and dark or off-white shades. Brushwork should support representational goals without expressive exaggeration, emphasizing accurate textures like rough fabric, worn surfaces, or natural environments.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) with naturalistic, direct lighting that accurately reveals forms and textures without dramatic effects. Use straightforward, honest compositions that prioritize clarity and realism over academic idealism or theatrical drama. Depict scenes with solidity and simplicity, avoiding complex structures or dynamic movements. Maintain focus on the accurate depiction of everyday environments, clothing, and objects, steering clear of stylization, strong outlines, or expressive, impressionistic brushwork.
