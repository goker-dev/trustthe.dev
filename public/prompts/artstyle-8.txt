Art Style:
Elongate human figures with small heads and contorted, serpentine poses ('figura serpentinata'). Use an artificial, intense, iridescent color palette — acid greens, electric blues, sharp pinks, and bright oranges — emphasizing decorative effect over naturalism. Create crowded, asymmetrical, and spatially ambiguous compositions with intricate details and smooth, polished surfaces. Avoid realistic proportions, harmonious balance, naturalistic colors, and stable, rational perspectives.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with theatrical, sharp lighting that heightens the tension and artifice. Use dynamic, tilted, or compressed viewpoints to accentuate the twisted poses and ambiguous space. The background should suggest an abstract, shallow setting — luxurious props or undefined environments that prioritize composition over realism. Maintain a refined, polished finish with intricate textural details, steering clear of naturalistic lighting, stable eye-level views, or rough, textured brushwork.
