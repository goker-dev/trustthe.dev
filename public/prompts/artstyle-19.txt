Art Style:
Apply the Futurism style by celebrating motion, dynamism, speed, and modern energy. Depict objects and figures in motion through fragmentation, repeated outlines, directional lines of force, and energetic brushstrokes. Incorporate multiple sequential stages of movement into a single image to convey simultaneity. Use a vibrant, high-key color palette influenced by Divisionism, with bright reds, oranges, yellows, strong blues, and dynamic greens, creating vivid contrasts. Emphasize the sensation of speed and chaotic energy, rejecting traditional static composition and embracing fractured, kinetic forms.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the artwork in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting, avoiding naturalistic light sources or shadows. Use a straight-on view to maintain surface dynamism without traditional perspective depth. Construct highly dynamic compositions dominated by diagonals, repeated forms, interpenetrating planes, and broken, vibrant color areas. Prioritize the energetic, fragmented sensation of movement and technological energy rather than realism or stability.
