Art Style:
Use the Neoclassical style characterized by the revival of Classical Greek and Roman aesthetics, emphasizing order, clarity, balance, logic, and seriousness. Focus on strong, precise drawing with clear contours and well-defined forms, prioritizing line over color. Depict figures with emotional restraint, calmness, and statuesque poses, often clothed in classical drapery or idealized nudity. Surfaces should be smooth and highly finished with minimal visible brushwork. The color palette should be restrained yet strong, utilizing rich reds, deep blues, stark whites, ochres, greys, subdued greens, and earthy browns, avoiding Rococo pastels and Baroque dramatic contrasts.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) with soft, even lighting that models forms subtly without dramatic shadows or chiaroscuro. Use a stable, ordered composition, favoring symmetrical or horizontally aligned arrangements resembling classical friezes. Figures should be parallel to the picture plane, arranged in a shallow, clearly defined spatial field. Maintain a polished, almost sculptural finish that emphasizes clarity of form and rational structure, steering clear of dynamic angles, fluid poses, atmospheric depth, or expressive brushstrokes.
