Concept: 
Visualize a scene reflecting intense inner turmoil, anxiety, or spirituality, like Munch's "The Scream" or Kirchner's street scenes. Utilize distorted forms, agitated brushwork, and jarring, non-naturalistic colors to convey subjective experience and psychological tension. The focus is on representing the artist's inner emotional reality rather than the external world's appearance.

Emotion target: 
Evoke strong, often uncomfortable emotions such as anxiety, fear, alienation, spiritual angst, or intense psychological states. Aim to directly communicate the artist's inner world and provoke an empathetic or visceral response in the viewer. Confront the emotional turbulence and spiritual condition of modern life.
