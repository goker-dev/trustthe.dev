Art Style:
Adopt the Early Christian and Byzantine Art aesthetic. Focus on spiritual and symbolic representation rather than naturalistic portrayal. Render human figures as elongated, slender, and ethereal forms, positioned frontally or near-frontally with large, iconic eyes. Maintain flattened spatial treatment, avoiding realistic depth or perspective. Use strong dark outlines to define distinct color areas. Employ a luminous gold background to symbolize the divine realm, surrounding figures with an aura of sacred light. Stylize drapery with linear, pattern-like folds rather than realistic flow. Hierarchical scale should be applied, emphasizing important figures. The surface texture should emulate the shimmering, uneven quality of glass mosaics.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with ambient lighting that enhances the shimmering, luminous effect of the mosaic. Use a direct, frontal view, slightly tilted upward as if viewing a grand apse or dome mosaic. Maintain a flat, non-spatial composition dominated by gold and colored glass tesserae textures. Focus on stylized, iconic presentation without depth, shadows, or realistic environmental details, keeping the visual language strictly spiritual and formal.
