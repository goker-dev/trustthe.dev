Concept: 
Represent an artwork reflecting current global issues, social concerns, or technological advancements, using any possible medium (installation, video, digital art, performance, traditional media employed in new ways). The work might engage with identity politics, environmental concerns, digital culture, or critique power structures. It should feel relevant to the present moment, potentially drawing on diverse artistic strategies and embracing hybridity.

Emotion target: 
Highly varied, reflecting the diversity of contemporary life itself. Can aim to provoke thought, foster empathy, incite social or political awareness, create sensory experiences, express personal identity, explore complex feelings (love, loss, anxiety, connection), or challenge the viewer's perspective on current realities. The emotional connection often stems from the relevance of the themes to lived experience today.
