Concept: 
Visualize the interior of a soaring Gothic cathedral, emphasizing verticality, ribbed vaults, pointed arches, and vast expanses of stained glass. Depict light filtering through the colored glass, creating an ethereal, transcendent atmosphere. Figures in sculpture or glass should appear more naturalistic than Romanesque examples but still serve a primarily spiritual purpose, perhaps depicting saints or biblical narratives that draw the eye upwards towards the heavens.

Emotion target: 
Inspire feelings of spiritual uplift, awe, wonder, and transcendence. Create a sense of being enveloped in divine light and reaching towards heaven. Foster emotional engagement with religious stories through increased naturalism while maintaining a focus on piety, devotion, and the grandeur of God.
