Concept: 
Visualize a scene from the life of Christ or saints depicted with flat, elongated figures against a gold, ethereal background (often in mosaic or fresco). Emphasize symbolic meaning over realistic representation; figures should appear otherworldly and communicate spiritual truths. Focus on hierarchical arrangements, frontal poses, large eyes conveying spiritual intensity, and symbolic gestures or attributes. The scene should function as a visual aid for teaching faith and inspiring devotion, directing the viewer's mind away from the material world towards the divine.

Emotion target: 
Inspire spiritual awe, piety, reverence, and contemplation of the divine mysteries. Evoke a sense of the sacred, the transcendent, and detachment from earthly concerns. Convey the solemnity of religious narratives and the authority of the Church and Christianized Empire. Foster a feeling of spiritual connection through iconic imagery meant to serve as windows to the sacred realm.
