Art Style:
Use the Ancient Greek red-figure vase painting style characterized by idealized human figures with accurate anatomy and proportions, depicted predominantly in profile or near-profile poses. Emphasize clear, precise black linework that defines contours and internal details such as musculature and drapery folds. Employ a limited color palette of terracotta orange-red figures against a glossy black background, with occasional fine details in golden-brown, white, or purple accents. Ensure smooth, slightly glossy pottery surfaces, with compositions balanced and adapted to fit curved vase forms, often arranged along a single ground line. Avoid volumetric shading, realistic perspective, photorealism, or non-Classical figure styles.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) under neutral, even lighting that clearly reveals the painted surface without casting strong shadows. Maintain a direct view that focuses on the two-dimensional composition of the vase, respecting the curvature but emphasizing the flat design. Depict figures dynamically and elegantly within the confines of the red-figure technique, avoiding realistic spatial depth, shading, modern rendering effects, or expanded color palettes. Keep the visual presentation consistent with authentic Ancient Greek terracotta pottery display contexts.
