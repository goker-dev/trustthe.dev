Concept: 
Present a realistic (veristic) portrait bust of a Roman patrician, emphasizing individual likeness, age, and character, conveying dignity and civic virtue. Alternatively, depict a grand architectural space like an aqueduct or amphitheater, showcasing engineering prowess and the scale of the Empire. Or, visualize a historical relief carving narrating a military victory or imperial ceremony, functioning as state propaganda. 
The emphasis should be on power, pragmatism, realism, and the documentation of history and authority.

Emotion target: 
Evoke feelings of awe towards imperial power, respect for authority and tradition, and civic pride. Convey the gravity, stability, and organizational might of the Roman state. In portraiture, elicit a sense of encountering a real, distinct individual with specific character traits and social standing. Instill confidence in the enduring strength and historical significance of Rome.
