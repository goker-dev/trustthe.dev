Art Style:
Apply the Postmodernism style, characterized by skepticism, irony, eclecticism, and the rejection of Modernist ideals like purity, originality, and universalism. Embrace complexity, contradiction, fragmentation, and humor. Techniques can include appropriation of existing images or styles, pastiche (stylistic imitation), collage, montage, installation, mixed media, and critical use of text. Surface and style may be slick, rough, kitschy, commercial, expressive, or historically referential depending on the strategy. There is no fixed visual language; emphasis is placed on commentary, subversion, and the construction of meaning.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) with flat, even, neutral lighting without a discernible source or shadows. Use a direct, straight-on camera view without dynamic angles. Composition should reflect the diverse, layered, or ironic sensibility of Postmodernism, possibly featuring appropriated elements, fragmented arrangements, or pastiche of historical styles. Texture, color, and medium choices are flexible and should serve the conceptual and critical stance of the artwork, rather than adhering to traditional aesthetic standards.
