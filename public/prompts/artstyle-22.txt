Art Style:
Apply the Abstract Expressionist style, emphasizing non-representational imagery created through spontaneous, gestural, and emotionally charged techniques. Explore two major approaches: Action Painting, which focuses on vigorous, physical mark-making like dripping, splashing, and impasto layers; and Color Field Painting, which emphasizes expansive, contemplative areas of luminous or somber color. Prioritize the artist's internal emotions, psychological states, or mythic concepts over narrative or recognizable forms. Use either highly textured, energetic surfaces (Action Painting) or large, soft-edged color planes (Color Field Painting) to evoke sublimity and transcendence.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting that does not create naturalistic shadows. Compose the scene either as an 'all-over' energetic surface without clear focal points (Action Painting) or with simplified, large color fields (Color Field Painting). Emphasize the material presence of the paint, surface variations, and dynamic or meditative energy. Avoid realistic spatial depth, traditional perspective, and detailed figure depiction. The focus should remain on abstract emotional resonance through process and pure visual experience.
