Concept: 
Visualize a landscape or still life, like one by Cézanne, where forms are simplified into underlying geometric shapes (cylinders, spheres, cones) and built up with structured patches of color. Alternatively, depict a scene by Van Gogh using swirling, energetic brushstrokes and intense, emotionally charged colors that convey the artist's inner state rather than just visual appearance. The emphasis is on structure, personal expression, symbolism, or emotional intensity, moving beyond the Impressionists' focus on fleeting light.

Emotion target: 
Evoke a deeper emotional response or intellectual engagement than Impressionism. Depending on the artist, the aim might be to convey order and permanence (Cézanne), intense personal feeling and spiritual searching (Van Gogh), symbolic meaning (Gauguin), or structured scientific observation (Seurat). Capture the artist's subjective experience and interpretation of reality.
