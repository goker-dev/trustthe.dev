    "sceneContext": {
        "lightingStyle": "Dramatic chiaroscuro or tenebrism is key. Strong directional light sources creating deep, enveloping shadows and intense, often focused highlights. Light sculpts forms, enhances drama, and creates strong emotional impact.",
        "cameraView": "Dynamic viewpoints are common (low-angle looking up, high-angle looking down, oblique angles) to emphasize movement, foreshortening, diagonals, and theatrical spatial recession. Close-ups may be used to heighten emotional intensity.",
        "settingSuggestion": "Settings enhance the drama: opulent interiors (palaces, churches with rich decoration like gilded frames, twisting columns), dramatic or turbulent landscapes, or stark, dark, undefined backgrounds (tenebrism) that isolate and spotlight the figures."
