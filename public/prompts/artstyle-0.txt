Art Style:
Use a Prehistoric Art approach based on Upper Paleolithic cave paintings. Focus on simplified, primal visual language characterized by strong contour lines, abstract human figures (schematic or stick-like), and symbolic representations. Emphasize rough, spontaneous application techniques such as dabbing, blowing pigments, and engraving lines into a textured rock surface. Natural earth pigments — ochres, charcoals, and manganese — dominate the limited color palette. Integrate the irregularities and textures of the rock wall into the composition to achieve an organic, raw aesthetic.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution). Use flat, indeterminate lighting without a discernible source to maintain the prehistoric cave environment feeling. Employ a direct, frontal or slight profile view, preserving the visual flatness typical of cave art. Simulate the rough, uneven rock surface texture as the canvas, allowing it to interact naturally with the figures. Avoid realistic anatomy, perspective, smooth surfaces, complex shading, or detailed architectural elements. Figures should appear scattered, isolated, or loosely clustered without formal composition or ground lines, reflecting the opportunistic, timeless nature of prehistoric wall art.
