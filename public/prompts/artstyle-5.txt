Art Style:
Adopt the Romanesque Art style (approx. 10th–12th centuries). Figures are simplified, heavy, and solid, emphasizing symbolic meaning over naturalistic representation. Human forms appear blocky, stiff, and often frontal, with large hands, feet, and heads to enhance narrative clarity. Drapery folds are stylized into rhythmic, linear, and simple patterns. Use strong, dark outlines to separate areas of color. Spatial treatment is flat and shallow, avoiding realistic perspective or depth. Backgrounds typically feature solid color fields or simple decorative motifs (geometric patterns, symbolic plants) instead of realistic landscapes. Hierarchical scale is applied to emphasize the importance of figures. Surface treatment is matte, earthy, and raw, with no luminous or reflective elements.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution). Lighting should be ambient and interior, but neutral and soft, not highlighting specific sources. There is no shimmering or glowing effect; instead, surfaces should appear matte and earth-toned, as if painted on plaster walls (fresco technique) or stone surfaces. Use a direct, frontal view; figures should be posed stiffly and symmetrically, emphasizing narrative clarity and hierarchical scale. Colors must be applied flatly, inside strong outlines, without shading, blending, or atmospheric depth. Maintain a sense of formal balance but allow a static, monumental feeling typical of Romanesque iconography.
