Concept: 
Visualize a scene from Roman history, like David's "Oath of the Horatii," emphasizing civic virtue, self-sacrifice, and rationality. Employ clear, sharp lines, balanced composition, subdued colors, and sculptural figures inspired by classical statuary. The setting should be austere and ordered, reflecting archaeological accuracy where possible. The narrative should convey a strong moral or patriotic message with clarity and gravity.

Emotion target: 
Inspire feelings of patriotism, civic virtue, rationality, seriousness, and moral clarity. Evoke admiration for heroism, self-restraint, and duty. The overall mood should be calm, ordered, and intellectually rigorous, rejecting frivolous emotion in favor of stoic resolve and timeless ideals derived from classical antiquity.
