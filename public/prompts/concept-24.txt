Concept: 
Visualize a simple, geometric form, like a cube or a series of identical rectangular boxes, made from industrial materials (e.g., steel, plexiglass). Place it directly on the floor or wall without a pedestal. The work should be devoid of ornamentation, figuration, or evidence of the artist's hand. Emphasize the object's literal presence, its material qualities, and its relationship to the surrounding space and the viewer.

Emotion target: 
Promote a direct, unmediated perceptual experience of the object and space. Aim for objectivity and neutrality, shifting focus away from the artist's emotion to the viewer's own awareness and physical encounter with the work. Can induce feelings of calmness, clarity, order, or presence through simplicity and reduction of visual noise.
