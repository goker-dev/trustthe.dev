Art Style:
Use the elegant Rococo style characterized by a light, airy pastel color palette — soft pinks, light blues, mint greens, creamy yellows, and ivory, accented with gold and silver. Favor asymmetrical, dynamic compositions enriched with S-curves, C-curves, and ornamental scrollwork ("rocaille"). Employ graceful, delicate figure rendering with smooth porcelain-like textures and feathery, refined brushwork. Maintain an overall atmosphere of lightness, charm, playfulness, and intimacy. Avoid dark, dramatic shadows, heavy forms, and stark emotional intensity — emphasizing elegance, decorative finesse, and fluidity.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with soft, diffused, luminous lighting, avoiding harsh shadows. Set the composition within an intimate, ornate environment, such as a Rococo-style garden or salon, featuring graceful curves and intricate decorative elements. Simulate the surface texture of oil on canvas or delicate pastel drawings, ensuring a smooth, blended finish. Avoid heavy, gritty realism, rigid symmetry, or minimalist austerity, maintaining a feeling of elegance, lightness, and fluid sophistication.
