Concept: 
Capture the fleeting visual sensation of a specific moment outdoors, like Monet painting haystacks or a bustling Parisian street scene. Emphasize the changing effects of light and atmosphere using visible, broken brushstrokes and pure, unmixed colors placed side-by-side. The composition should feel spontaneous and immediate, prioritizing the artist's subjective perception of light and color over detailed rendering or narrative.

Emotion target: 
Evoke the sensory experience and atmosphere of the moment â€“ the warmth of sunlight, the vibrancy of colors, the movement of air, the energy of modern life. Convey feelings of immediacy, spontaneity, and visual delight. The aim is often to capture a fleeting feeling of joy, tranquility, or the simple beauty perceived in a transient instant.
