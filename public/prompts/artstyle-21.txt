Art Style:
Apply the Surrealist style by exploring dreams, the unconscious, and irrational juxtapositions. Create scenes populated with bizarre, unrelated elements placed in unexpected and illogical contexts. Emphasize either hyperrealistic, meticulously detailed rendering to heighten the dreamlike strangeness (Veristic Surrealism) or abstract, biomorphic forms generated through automatism and subconscious techniques (Abstract Surrealism). Incorporate surprising scale distortions, metamorphosis, organic abstractions, and psychological symbolism. Use either smooth, polished textures for detailed works or free, spontaneous surface treatments for abstract expressions.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) using soft, dreamlike lighting or a flat, ambient glow without clear directional shadows. Compose the scene with illogical spatial arrangements, deep or ambiguous perspective, or free-floating elements in undefined environments. Simulate either smooth, highly finished textures or expressive, textured effects like frottage or grattage depending on the sub-style. Prioritize surreal atmospheres, uncanny details, and emotionally charged or subconscious-driven associations over rational structure or traditional realism.
