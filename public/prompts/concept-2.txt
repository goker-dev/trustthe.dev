Concept: 
Depict an idealized athletic figure or a mythological hero captured in a moment of balanced action or poised contemplation (e.g., using contrapposto). Focus on anatomical accuracy, harmonious proportions, and the potential of the human form. Alternatively, visualize a scene from mythology rendered with clarity and narrative focus on a vase. Emphasize the rational structure, balance, and idealized beauty reflecting Greek philosophical values. The forms should feel both naturalistic and perfected, embodying the pursuit of human excellence (aret√©).

Emotion target: 
Inspire admiration for human potential, intellectual clarity, and idealized beauty. Evoke a sense of balance, harmony, order, and rational control. Capture the dignity of the human form and the celebration of human achievement, whether physical, intellectual, or civic. In later periods, aim for increased pathos and dramatic tension while retaining underlying classical ideals.
