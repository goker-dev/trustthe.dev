Concept: 
Depict a familiar object, like a guitar or a face, simultaneously from multiple viewpoints, breaking it down into fragmented geometric planes and facets. Overlap these planes on a flattened picture surface, abandoning traditional perspective. In early (Analytical) Cubism, use a restricted, monochromatic palette (browns, grays) to focus on structure. In later (Synthetic) Cubism, reintroduce color and incorporate elements of collage (like newspaper text).

Emotion target: 
Primarily stimulate intellectual engagement and challenge traditional ways of seeing and representing reality. Evoke a sense of complexity, fragmentation, simultaneity, and the analytical process of perception. The emotional impact is generally subdued, focusing more on formal innovation and the redefinition of pictorial space.
