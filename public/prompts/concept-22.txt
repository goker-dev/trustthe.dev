Concept: 
Visualize a large canvas covered in dynamic, energetic drips and splatters of paint (like Pollock's Action Painting), emphasizing the physical process and spontaneous gesture. Alternatively, imagine vast fields of luminous, contemplative color that seem to envelop the viewer (like Rothko's Color Field painting). The work should be non-representational, focusing on the expressive qualities of paint, color, texture, and scale.

Emotion target: 
Evoke powerful, direct emotional or spiritual responses through abstract means. Action Painting might convey energy, anxiety, chaos, or raw feeling. Color Field painting might inspire awe, transcendence, introspection, or profound calm. The aim is often an immersive, personal encounter with the artwork's emotional presence.
