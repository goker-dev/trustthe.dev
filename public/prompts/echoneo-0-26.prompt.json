            "Reaction against Modernist principles (e.g., universalism, originality, purity of form)",
            "Characterized by skepticism, irony, and eclecticism; no single unified style",
            "Embraces complexity, contradiction, ambiguity, and humor",

Employs fragmentation, juxtaposition, layering, appropriation of existing compositions, pastiche, or deliberately awkward/unbalanced arrangements.
