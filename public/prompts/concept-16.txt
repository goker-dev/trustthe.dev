Concept: 
Depict a landscape or portrait using bold, vibrant, non-naturalistic colors applied with energetic, often unblended brushstrokes. Imagine a scene like Derain's views of London or Matisse's portraits where color is liberated from description – skies might be orange, faces green – used purely for its expressive and decorative power. Simplify forms and flatten space to emphasize the impact of color harmonies and dissonances.

Emotion target: 
Evoke feelings of exuberance, joy, energy, and sensory intensity through the powerful use of color. Aim for a direct, instinctual emotional impact rather than nuanced psychological portrayal. Convey the artist's subjective feeling and excitement about the subject, celebrating the visual pleasure of pure, intense color and spontaneous execution.
