Concept: 
Present the artwork primarily as an idea, which might be communicated through text, instructions, photographs, maps, or documentation rather than a traditional aesthetic object. For example, visualize Joseph Kosuth's "One and Three Chairs" (an actual chair, a photograph of the chair, and a dictionary definition of "chair"). The focus is on the thought process, definition, or concept itself, often questioning the nature of art and its institutions.

Emotion target: 
Prioritize intellectual engagement, questioning, and critical thinking over direct emotional response. Aim to provoke thought about the definition of art, language, meaning, and context. Any emotional impact often arises from contemplating the idea presented or the critique implied, rather than from the visual form itself.
