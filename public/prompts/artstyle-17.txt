Art Style:
Apply the Expressionism style, focusing on expressing intense subjective emotions rather than objective reality. Distort forms, colors, and space to maximize emotional impact. Use bold, jarring, and non-naturalistic colors, with vigorous, agitated brushwork. Figures should appear simplified, primitive, mask-like, or distorted, emphasizing psychological intensity over anatomical accuracy. Composition should reject traditional balance and embrace dynamic, uneasy, or claustrophobic arrangements with sharp diagonals and compressed space. Surface textures should be raw, energetic, and expressive, inspired by techniques like thick impasto or woodcut-like gouged effects.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the artwork in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting and no realistic shadows. Use a direct, straight-on perspective without complex angles or atmospheric depth. Focus on strong outlines, intense color contrasts, distorted forms, and emotionally charged arrangements. Avoid realistic perspective, smooth blending, or anatomical correctness. Let visible, rough brushstrokes or raw textures enhance the emotional immediacy and unease of the scene.
