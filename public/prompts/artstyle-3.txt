Art Style:
Use the Ancient Roman fresco painting style characterized by realistic depiction of figures and settings, with a strong emphasis on verism in portraiture. Apply chiaroscuro modeling to create three-dimensional volume and use illusionistic techniques, such as linear and atmospheric perspective, to suggest spatial depth. Utilize a rich, varied color palette including Pompeian Reds, yellows, greens, blues, blacks, and whites for naturalistic representation. Ensure a smooth, polished fresco surface with detailed painted textures representing materials like marble, fabric, and foliage. Favor dynamic, complex compositions framed by architectural elements, while avoiding flatness, heavy outlines, stylization, and photorealism.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) using naturalistic lighting depicted within the painted scene to model forms and convey realistic volume. Adopt an eye-level perspective to reinforce the illusion of depth, employing architectural framing and perspective techniques typical of Roman wall paintings. Maintain a smooth, fresco-like finish, avoiding visible brushstrokes or impasto. Frame the narrative with painted architectural elements such as columns, arches, or garden landscapes, and steer clear of medieval stylistic conventions, gold backgrounds, and purely symbolic or cartoonish representations.
