Art Style:
Apply the Cubism style by depicting the subject through multiple simultaneous viewpoints. Fragment objects and figures into geometric facets and overlapping planes, merging background and foreground into a flattened or ambiguous space. Emphasize structure, form, and analysis rather than realistic depiction. For Analytical Cubism, use a near-monochromatic palette (browns, greys, ochres, black, off-white) with intricate faceted textures. For Synthetic Cubism, introduce brighter flat colors (reds, blues, greens, yellows) and consider incorporating collage elements. Prioritize geometric abstraction, layered space, and the breakdown of single-point perspective.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render the artwork in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting, avoiding shadows or naturalistic light sources. Maintain a direct, straight-on view to emphasize the two-dimensional surface. Construct complex, layered compositions for Analytical Cubism, or use simpler, flatter color planes with possible textural contrasts for Synthetic Cubism. Avoid traditional realistic perspective, smooth blending, or volumetric shading. Focus on conveying form through intersecting planes, fragmented space, and flattened depth.
