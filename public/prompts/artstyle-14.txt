Art Style:
Use the Impressionism style characterized by capturing the fleeting visual impression of a moment, focusing especially on the effects of light, atmosphere, and color. Apply short, visible brushstrokes and place pure, often unmixed colors side-by-side for optical mixing. Depict scenes with vibrant luminosity, avoiding black for shadows and using blues, purples, and complementary tones instead. Favor spontaneity and immediacy over precise contours or detailed rendering. Emphasize the shimmering quality of light with energetic surface textures and a bright, lively palette including bright blues, vibrant greens, sunny yellows, oranges, pinks, and violets.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536Ã—1024 resolution) using natural, diffused lighting that enhances color vibrancy without creating deep shadows. Compose scenes informally and spontaneously, with asymmetrical balance, open compositions, and occasional unconventional cropping or viewpoints. Maintain an airy, fresh feel in the arrangement, suggesting a snapshot of life or a fleeting outdoor moment. Allow visible brushwork and color interactions to form the impression rather than relying on detailed linework or rigid forms, steering away from photorealistic clarity or heavy modeling.
