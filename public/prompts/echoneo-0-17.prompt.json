            "Primary goal: Express subjective emotions, inner turmoil, and psychological states rather than objective reality",
            "Distortion of form, color, and space for emotional impact",
            "Intense, often jarring, non-naturalistic colors used subjectively to convey feelings (angst, spirituality, alienation)",
            "Bold, energetic, often crude or agitated brushwork",

        "textureEmphasis": "Brushwork is typically highly visible, energetic, agitated, or thick with impasto, directly conveying the artist's emotional state and the intensity of the subject. Woodcut influence emphasizes raw, gouged textures.",
        "compositionStyle": "Often features distorted perspective, jarring diagonals, compressed or claustrophobic space, and dynamic, agitated arrangements. Rejects traditional harmony and balance in favor of compositions that enhance emotional intensity, unease, or spiritual fervor.",
