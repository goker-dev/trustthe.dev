Concept: 
Visualize a nonsensical assemblage or collage combining found objects, fragmented text from newspapers, and machine parts, perhaps alongside a deliberately defaced reproduction of a famous artwork. The composition should feel random, chaotic, and provocative, rejecting traditional aesthetics and rational structure. It could also be a performance featuring simultaneous nonsensical poems or bizarre costumes, designed to challenge and disrupt audience expectations.

Emotion target: 
Evoke feelings of absurdity, disorientation, humor, irony, or outrage. Aim to shock the viewer out of conventional thinking and complacency. Convey a deep critique of war, nationalism, and bourgeois values through irrationality and anti-art gestures, reflecting disillusionment and a desire to dismantle established norms.
