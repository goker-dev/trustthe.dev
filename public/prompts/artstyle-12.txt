Art Style:
Use the Romanticism style characterized by strong emotion, individualism, imagination, and dramatic atmosphere. Depict nature as powerful, wild, and untamed, often dwarfing human figures or reflecting human moods. Employ dynamic, turbulent, or evocative scenes that convey awe, terror, passion, or melancholy. Utilize expressive, visible brushwork with glazing, scumbling, or impasto techniques to build atmospheric effects. Favor rich, evocative color palettes with deep blues, stormy grays, intense reds, earthy greens, golden lights, and misty whites. Focus on light's emotional impact, such as sunsets, storms, or fog, avoiding rigid classical order or restraint.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with dramatic, mood-enhancing lighting, employing chiaroscuro effects to heighten emotional tension. Compose scenes dynamically and asymmetrically, using strong diagonals, swirling movements, or vast natural expanses. Create a sense of atmosphere with visible texture and brushwork, emphasizing elements like mist, storm clouds, water surfaces, or rugged terrain. Avoid classical symmetry, flat perspectives, or clean, polished finishes — instead favor expressive depth, emotional resonance, and an immersive, sublime experience.
