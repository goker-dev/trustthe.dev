Concept: 
Present an unidealized scene of contemporary, everyday life, particularly focusing on the labor or struggles of the working class, like Courbet's "The Stone Breakers." Utilize an objective, straightforward style with often somber or earthy colors, avoiding romantic or academic conventions. The subject matter should be depicted truthfully, without sentimentality, highlighting social conditions or the dignity of ordinary existence.

Emotion target: 
Evoke empathy, social awareness, and a sense of objective truth. Convey the reality of contemporary life, including its hardships and mundane aspects. Aim for authenticity and honesty, potentially inspiring reflection on social conditions or simply connecting the viewer to the unvarnished human experience.
