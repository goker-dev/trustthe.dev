                "(Veristic): Naturalistic but potentially intense blues, ochres, flesh tones, deep shadows.",

        "compositionStyle": "Based on illogical or dreamlike associations and juxtapositions. Veristic style often uses deep, illusionistic perspective but populates it irrationally. Abstract/Automatist style frequently features biomorphic forms floating or interacting in ambiguous, flat, or undefined space.",
