Art Style:
Use the Post-Impressionism style characterized by diverse, individualized approaches that move beyond capturing fleeting impressions. Emphasize structure, personal expression, symbolism, or form depending on the approach. Styles may include geometric structure building (Cézanne), emotional intensity through bold brushwork and color (Van Gogh), symbolic and non-naturalistic color usage (Gauguin), or scientific color theories like Pointillism (Seurat). Forms may appear simplified, flattened, or dynamically fragmented. Color palettes vary widely: intense yellows, blues, and greens (Van Gogh); rich reds, pinks, and symbolic hues (Gauguin); structural greens, ochres, blues (Cézanne); or pure color dots across the spectrum (Seurat). Brushwork and surface textures are highly varied — from thick impasto to meticulous dotting.

Scene & Technical Details:
Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using flat or naturalistic lighting, depending on stylistic intention. Allow flexible composition strategies: structured and geometric, dynamically swirling, formally ordered, or decoratively flat. Accept expressive brushwork, visible paint textures, color contrasts, and structural or emotional exaggerations based on artistic choice. Avoid strict realism or photographic perspectives — instead focus on personal interpretation of form, color, and emotion to define the scene's visual and emotional impact.
