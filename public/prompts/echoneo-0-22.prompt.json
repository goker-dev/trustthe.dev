        "origin": "Abstract Expressionism (Primarily New York, USA, c. 1940s - 1950s AD)",
        "visualCharacteristics": [
            "Emphasis on non-representational (abstract) imagery",
            "Focus on spontaneous, subconscious creation (automatism influence) or profound emotional/spiritual expression",
            "Large scale canvases often used ('heroic' scale)",
            "Two main tendencies: Action Painting (emphasizing the physical act and gesture) and Color Field Painting (emphasizing large areas of color)",
            "Expresses inner emotions, psychological states, mythic archetypes, or the sublime",

        "techniques": [
            "Action Painting Simulation: Dripping, pouring, splashing paint; vigorous, gestural brushwork; layering; impasto",
            "Color Field Painting Simulation: Staining raw canvas with thin washes of paint; applying large, flat or subtly modulated areas of color; creating soft or hard edges between color fields",

            "description": "Highly variable. Action Painting often involves complex layering or dramatic contrasts (e.g., black and white). Color Field Painting focuses intensely on the relationships between large areas of color, which can be vibrant, somber, luminous, or atmospheric, chosen for specific emotional or spiritual resonance.",
            "keyColors": [
                "(Action): Often Black, White, plus layered primaries, earth tones, etc.",
                "(Color Field): Large fields of Reds, Yellows, Oranges, Blues, Maroons, Blacks, etc., depending on the artist (e.g., Rothko, Newman)"
            ]
        },
        "textureEmphasis": "Action Painting: Highly textural surfaces resulting from drips, thick impasto, energetic brushwork, and built-up layers; texture reflects the physical process. Color Field Painting: Often minimizes physical texture to emphasize the optical effects of flat, stained color fields, though edges between colors can have textural variations.",
        "compositionStyle": "Action Painting: Often 'all-over' compositions lacking traditional focal points or hierarchy, emphasizing the energetic gesture across the entire canvas. Color Field Painting: Simplified compositions dominated by large, expansive areas of color, often symmetrical or using minimal divisions (like Barnett Newman's 'zips') to create a contemplative or overwhelming effect.",
