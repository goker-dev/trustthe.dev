Concept: 
Depict a dramatic moment of religious ecstasy or martyrdom, like Bernini's "Ecstasy of Saint Teresa," using dynamic movement, intense contrast of light and shadow (chiaroscuro), and rich textures. Emphasize theatricality and direct engagement with the viewer. The composition should feel energetic, ornate, and emotionally charged, designed to overwhelm the senses and convey spiritual fervor or power.

Emotion target: 
Evoke strong emotions: awe, wonder, intense piety, spiritual transport, drama, passion, or even shock. Aim to directly involve the viewer emotionally and spiritually, making the depicted event feel immediate and powerful. Convey a sense of grandeur, dynamism, and the sensuous splendor of the divine or the powerful.
