Concept: 
Depict an intimate gathering of elegantly dressed aristocrats engaged in lighthearted flirtation or leisurely pursuits within a sumptuously decorated salon or an idyllic garden setting. Utilize soft pastel colors, graceful S-curves and C-curves (rocaille), asymmetrical ornamentation, and diffused, gentle lighting. The scene should emphasize charm, playfulness, and decorative elegance over grand narratives or deep meaning.

Emotion target: 
Evoke feelings of lightness, charm, grace, intimacy, and playful sensuality. Create an atmosphere of refined pleasure, leisure, and romantic escapism. The overall mood should be delightful, elegant, and visually enchanting, reflecting the sophisticated tastes and intimate social rituals of the aristocracy.
