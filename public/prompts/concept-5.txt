Concept: 
Illustrate a scene from the Last Judgment carved in high relief on the tympanum above a church doorway. Depict Christ enthroned, surrounded by angels and apostles, with clear divisions between the saved and the damned below. Use stylized, elongated figures with clear gestures conveying narrative and moral lessons. The composition should feel solid, ordered, and somewhat severe, emphasizing the authority of the Church and the weighty themes of judgment and salvation within a massive, fortress-like architectural setting.

Emotion target: 
Evoke a sense of religious awe, reverence for divine authority, and perhaps fear of judgment. Convey the seriousness of Christian doctrine and the stability and protective power of the Church in an uncertain world. The overall feeling should be one of solemnity, didactic clarity, and enduring faith.
