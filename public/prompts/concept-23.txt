Concept: 
Depict an everyday consumer object, like a soup can or soda bottle, or a celebrity icon, like Marilyn Monroe, using techniques borrowed from commercial art (bold colors, flat surfaces, screen printing). Often uses repetition or large scale to mimic mass production and advertising. The style should be clean, graphic, and immediately recognizable, referencing popular culture directly.

Emotion target: 
Evoke feelings associated with popular culture and consumerism â€“ familiarity, nostalgia, fascination with celebrity, desire, or perhaps irony and detachment. Blur the lines between "high" art and everyday life, prompting reflection on mass media, commercialism, and the icons of contemporary society, often with a cool, ambiguous attitude.
