Concept: 
Depict a lone figure confronting the awesome power of nature (the sublime), such as Friedrich's "Wanderer above the Sea of Fog," or a dramatic historical or exotic scene filled with intense action and feeling. Utilize dynamic compositions, rich or turbulent color, and expressive brushwork. The emphasis should be on individual experience, imagination, intuition, and the overwhelming forces of nature or human passion.

Emotion target: 
Evoke strong emotions such as awe, wonder, terror, passion, melancholy, longing, or heroic struggle. Aim to capture the intensity of individual subjective experience and the power of the untamed natural world or human imagination. Foster a sense of mystery, the sublime, and the depth of inner feeling over rational control.
