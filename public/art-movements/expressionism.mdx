## Overview & Key Characteristics

Expressionism was a powerful modernist movement that flourished primarily in Germany and Austria from the early 20th century into the 1920s and 30s. Rather than depicting external reality accurately, Expressionism sought to convey **intense subjective emotions, inner psychological states, anxieties, and spiritual visions**. It achieved this through **boldly distorted forms, exaggerated or arbitrary colors, vigorous and often harsh brushwork or printmaking techniques, and unsettling or emotionally charged imagery**. Arising in a period of rapid industrialization, urbanization, and growing social and political tension leading up to and following World War I, Expressionism often reflects the anxieties, alienation, and spiritual searching of modern life. Key groups included *Die Brücke* (The Bridge) in Dresden and Berlin, known for its raw intensity and urban themes, and *Der Blaue Reiter* (The Blue Rider) in Munich, which explored spirituality and abstraction through color and form.

**Summary of Common Characteristics (Esp. German Expressionism):**

| Feature         | Characteristic Description                                                                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light           | Often non-naturalistic, manipulated for emotional effect. Can be harsh, glaring, or create deep, unsettling shadows, contributing to the overall mood of anxiety or intensity. |
| Surface/Texture | **Often Rough, Energetic, Raw:** Features visible, sometimes violent brushstrokes; jagged lines in woodcuts; thick application of paint. Emphasizes immediacy and emotional force over polished finish. |
| Figures         | **Distorted, Exaggerated, Angular:** Figures frequently elongated, contorted, mask-like, or crudely rendered to express inner turmoil, alienation, or primal energy. Rejects idealized or naturalistic anatomy. |
| Space/Depth     | **Often Subjective & Warped:** Perspective frequently ignored or deliberately distorted. Space can feel compressed, claustrophobic, tilted, unstable, or dream-like, reflecting psychological states. |
| Color Palette   | **Intense, Arbitrary, Often Dissonant:** Color used non-descriptively to express emotion. Can employ vibrant, clashing hues or dark, brooding tones. Color choices driven by inner feeling rather than observation. |
| Composition     | **Often Jarring, Unbalanced, Dynamic:** Compositions deliberately avoid classical harmony. Can be crowded, fragmented, asymmetrical, using diagonals or sharp angles to create tension and unease. |
| Details/Lines   | Detail often simplified or crudely executed. Lines are frequently angular, jagged (esp. in woodcuts), thick, swirling, or nervously energetic, conveying intense feeling. |
| **Mood/Emotion**| **Intense Subjectivity, Anxiety, Angst, Alienation, Spirituality, Ecstasy, Social Critique.** Expresses deep inner feelings, often negative ones related to modern life, war, or psychological distress, but also spiritual searching and primal energy. |
| **Subject Matter**| Psychological states, inner turmoil, modern urban life (alienation, decadence, street scenes), spirituality and religious themes (treated intensely/personally), portraits revealing inner character, nudes, emotionally charged landscapes, responses to war and social decay. |

Expressionism prioritized the internal world of feeling over the external world of appearances.

## Historical Context & Influences

Expressionism emerged and evolved within a turbulent historical period:
* **Pre-WWI Tensions:** Rapid industrialization, urbanization creating social alienation, rising nationalism and militarism in Germany and Austria.
* **Interest in Psychology & Philosophy:** Influence of Freudian psychology (the subconscious) and philosophers like Nietzsche (critique of bourgeois values, emphasis on primal forces).
* **World War I (1914-1918):** The devastating experience of the war profoundly impacted many Expressionist artists, leading to themes of trauma, death, and disillusionment (especially in Neue Sachlichkeit).
* **Weimar Republic (Germany, 1919-1933):** A period of political instability, economic hardship, but also cultural ferment, reflected in the sharp social critique of artists like Dix and Grosz.
* **Rise of Nazism:** Expressionism was condemned by the Nazis as "degenerate art" (*Entartete Kunst*), leading to persecution of artists, confiscation and destruction of artworks.

**Influences:** Expressionism drew from various sources:
* **Post-Impressionism:** Especially **Van Gogh** (emotional use of color/brushwork), **Gauguin** (symbolic color, interest in 'primitive'), and **Edvard Munch** (Norwegian painter whose psychologically charged works like *The Scream* were direct precursors).
* **"Primitive" Art:** Fascination with the perceived directness, power, and spirituality of African, Oceanic, and folk art.
* **Medieval German Art:** Particularly the strong lines, emotional intensity, and spiritual focus of medieval woodcuts (Dürer, Cranach).
* **Fauvism:** Shared an interest in liberating color, though Expressionism often explored darker emotional territory.
* **Die Brücke (The Bridge; founded 1905):** Group including Kirchner, Heckel, Schmidt-Rottluff, Nolde. Focused on intense emotion, urban alienation, raw technique (esp. woodcuts).
* **Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider; founded 1911):** Group including Kandinsky, Marc, Macke, Münter. Focused more on spiritual values in art, connections between color/sound/spirituality, moving towards abstraction.

## Key Artists & Their Contributions

* **Edvard Munch (1863-1944):** Norwegian forerunner; explored universal themes of anxiety, love, death with powerful psychological intensity.
* **Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938):** Leading figure of Die Brücke; known for intense, jagged depictions of Berlin street life and psychological tension.
* **Emil Nolde (1867-1956):** Associated with Die Brücke; powerful, often dark colors, religious themes, interest in masks and "primitive" forms.
* **Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):** Key figure in Der Blaue Reiter and a pioneer of abstract painting; sought to express inner spiritual reality through non-representational color and form. Author of *Concerning the Spiritual in Art*.
* **Franz Marc (1880-1916):** Member of Der Blaue Reiter; used vibrant color symbolically in paintings of animals, seeking spiritual harmony in nature. Died in WWI.
* **Egon Schiele (1890-1918):** Austrian Expressionist; known for his raw, linear, psychologically intense self-portraits and depictions of the human body.
* **Oskar Kokoschka (1886-1980):** Austrian; known for nervously energetic, psychologically probing portraits and cityscapes.
* **Max Beckmann (1884-1950):** Developed a powerful, often allegorical style addressing trauma and spiritual crisis, especially after WWI (often linked to Neue Sachlichkeit).
* **Otto Dix (1891-1969) & George Grosz (1893-1959):** Associated with Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity); used Expressionist techniques for savage social satire and depictions of war's brutality and Weimar society's decadence.

## Legacy and Influence

Expressionism was a defining movement of early 20th-century modernism with a lasting impact:
* It placed radical emphasis on subjective experience and emotional expression as the primary purpose of art.
* Developed potent visual strategies (distortion, color, line) for conveying psychological and spiritual states.
* Significantly influenced the development of **Abstract Expressionism** in the United States after WWII.
* Inspired **Neo-Expressionism** in the 1980s.
* Revitalized printmaking, especially the woodcut, as a powerful medium for modern artists.
* Its confrontation with difficult themes of anxiety, alienation, and societal critique continues to resonate in contemporary art. The persecution of Expressionists by the Nazis ironically cemented their importance as critical voices against oppression.
