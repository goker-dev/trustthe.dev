## Overview & Key Characteristics

Dada erupted amidst the chaos of World War I, originating in neutral Zurich around 1916 at the Cabaret Voltaire, a gathering place for exiled artists and writers horrified by the slaughter and the nationalist, rationalist culture they believed caused it. More an attitude and a protest than a unified style, Dada was vehemently **anti-war, anti-bourgeois, and fundamentally anti-art**, at least in the traditional sense. It embraced **irrationality, chance, absurdity, intuition, and nihilistic humor** as weapons against the perceived bankrupt logic and aesthetics of the established order. Dadaists sought to shock, provoke, and dismantle conventions through diverse means, including **performance (sound poetry, manifestos), visual arts (collage, photomontage, assemblage using found objects), typography, publications, and Marcel Duchamp's radical "readymades"** (mass-produced objects presented as art). The very name "Dada," chosen randomly, reflects the movement's embrace of meaninglessness.

**Summary of Common Characteristics:**

| Feature         | Characteristic Description (Dada)                                                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light           | Generally irrelevant as an aesthetic concern. Used functionally in photography/photomontage.           |
| Surface/Texture | **Diverse, Found, Juxtaposed:** Deliberate use of everyday materials, newspaper clippings, photos, scraps, machine parts. Rejects traditional 'fine art' surfaces; texture often results from collage/assemblage. |
| Figures/Objects | **Fragmented, Recontextualized, Absurd:** Use of **readymade** objects, found images (photomontage), nonsensical combinations. Figures often satirized (Grosz) or deconstructed. Challenges the idea of artistic creation. |
| Space/Depth     | **Illogical, Collaged, Flattened:** Rejects illusionistic space. Space is often created by layering found materials or through jarring juxtapositions in photomontage. Can be deliberately chaotic or nonsensical. |
| Color Palette   | **Arbitrary, Found, Graphic:** Color determined by found materials or used for strong graphic impact (e.g., black, white, red in posters/typography). No interest in naturalistic or harmonious color. |
| Composition     | **Chaotic, Chance-Driven, Asymmetrical:** Often embraces **chance operations** (Arp). Designed to disrupt visual harmony and rational order. Jarring juxtapositions are key. Focus on provocation over aesthetics. |
| Details/Lines   | Found text and images are crucial. Lines can be mechanical (Picabia), satirical/cartoonish (Grosz), fragmented, or part of typographic design. Rejects traditional skilled draftsmanship. |
| **Mood/Emotion**| **Ironic, Absurdist, Nihilistic, Critical, Playful (subversively), Angry, Provocative, Anti-Establishment.** Expresses disgust, challenges norms, celebrates nonsense, aims to shock and liberate from convention. |
| **Subject Matter**| **Critique of War, Nationalism, Bourgeois Values.** **The Absurdity of Logic & Language.** **Questioning the Nature of Art:** Originality, authorship, aesthetics. **Mass Media & Modern Life:** Use of found imagery, typography. **Chance & Irrationality.** |

Dada aimed not to create new aesthetic forms, but to destroy old ones and question the very basis of art and culture.

## Historical Context & Influences

Dada was born directly from the trauma and disillusionment of World War I:
* **World War I (1914-1918):** The unprecedented scale of destruction fueled profound cynicism about progress, reason, and nationalism. Zurich, in neutral Switzerland, became a refuge.
* **Post-War Instability:** Spread to centers like Berlin during the chaotic early years of the Weimar Republic, where it took on a more overtly political, satirical character.
* **Avant-Garde Precedents:** Built on the iconoclastic and provocative spirit of earlier movements like **Futurism** (using manifestos, performance, typography) but sharply rejected its nationalism and pro-war stance. Incorporated techniques from **Cubist collage**. Inspired by absurdist writers like **Alfred Jarry**.

**Influences:** Primarily a reaction *against* the prevailing social, political, and artistic norms perceived as contributing to the war. Influenced by skepticism, anarchism, and a desire to start from zero.

## Key Artists & Their Contributions by Center

* **Zurich (Cabaret Voltaire, 1916 onwards):** (Focus on performance, abstraction, chance)
    * **Hugo Ball:** Poet, performer, key founder of Cabaret Voltaire; performed abstract sound poems like *Karawane*.
    * **Tristan Tzara:** Romanian poet, primary theorist, promoter, author of Dada manifestos.
    * **Jean (Hans) Arp:** Sculptor and painter; explored chance in creating collages and abstract biomorphic reliefs.
    * **Marcel Janco, Richard Huelsenbeck, Sophie Taeuber-Arp:** Also key participants in performances, visual arts.
* **Berlin (c. 1918 onwards):** (More political, invention of photomontage)
    * **Raoul Hausmann & Hannah Höch:** Pioneered political photomontage, critiquing Weimar society, gender roles.
    * **George Grosz & John Heartfield:** Used drawing and photomontage for powerful anti-militarist, anti-capitalist satire.
* **Hanover:** **Kurt Schwitters:** Developed his unique "Merz" concept – creating art from urban detritus (collages, assemblages, the environmental *Merzbau*).
* **Cologne:** **Max Ernst:** Worked with collage and irrational juxtaposition, later a key Surrealist.
* **Paris (Post-WWI):** (More literary, philosophical; bridge to Surrealism)
    * **Francis Picabia:** Created ironic 'mechanomorphic' paintings and drawings, published Dada journal *391*.
    * **Man Ray:** American photographer and object-maker associated with Dada and Surrealism.
    * Arrival of **Tristan Tzara** in 1920 intensified Paris Dada activities.
* **New York (Earlier, independent spirit):**
    * **Marcel Duchamp:** French artist whose pre-Dada and concurrent activities profoundly challenged art's definitions with **readymades** (*Fountain*, *Bicycle Wheel*), conceptualism, and irony.
    * **Man Ray, Francis Picabia:** Also active in New York circle around Alfred Stieglitz's gallery '291'.

## Notable Works

* **Readymades/Conceptual:** Duchamp, *Fountain* (1917), *Bicycle Wheel* (1913), *L.H.O.O.Q.* (1919), *The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass)* (1915-23).
* **Photomontage/Collage:** Höch, *Cut with the Kitchen Knife...*; Hausmann, *Tatlin at Home*; Heartfield's anti-Nazi montages (later); Schwitters' *Merz* pictures; Arp's chance collages; Ernst's collage novels.
* **Painting/Drawing:** Picabia's machine portraits; Grosz's satirical drawings.
* **Performance/Texts:** Ball's sound poetry; Tzara's manifestos; Dada journals (*Cabaret Voltaire*, *Dada*, *Merz*, *391*).

## Legacy and Influence

Despite its relatively short lifespan and "anti-art" stance, Dada's impact on subsequent art is immense and ongoing:
* It fundamentally challenged traditional notions of art, authorship, originality, and aesthetics.
* Introduced radical techniques like photomontage, assemblage, readymades, and performance art into the artistic vocabulary.
* Its embrace of chance, irrationality, and humor opened new paths for artistic exploration.
* The spirit of protest, institutional critique, and blurring of art/life continues to inform contemporary art.
* Directly paved the way for **Surrealism**, which sought to channel Dada's exploration of the irrational into a more systematic investigation of the subconscious mind (many Dadaists became Surrealists).
* Influenced later movements like **Fluxus, Neo-Dada (Rauschenberg, Johns), Pop Art, Conceptual Art,** and performance art.
