## Overview & Key Characteristics

The Renaissance, meaning "rebirth" in French, was a period of profound cultural, artistic, and intellectual change that began in Florence, Italy, around 1400 and spread across Europe over the next two centuries. It marked a transition from the medieval era to modernity, characterized by a renewed interest in the art, literature, and philosophy of classical antiquity (ancient Greece and Rome). Key tenets include **Humanism** (emphasizing human potential, achievement, and reason), a quest for **naturalism** based on observation and scientific inquiry (including anatomy and optics), and the development of techniques like **linear perspective** to create realistic depictions of space. Artists rose in status from craftspeople to respected intellectuals and geniuses, supported by diverse patrons including the Church, wealthy families (like the Medici), guilds, and courts. While originating in Italy, the Renaissance also unfolded uniquely in Northern Europe, with artists there pioneering oil painting techniques and focusing on meticulous detail and complex symbolism.

**Summary of Common Characteristics (Focus on Italian High Renaissance Ideal):**

| Feature         | Characteristic Description                                                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light           | **Naturalistic & Modeled:** Use of *chiaroscuro* (light-dark contrast) to create volume. Soft, atmospheric light (*sfumato*) associated with Leonardo. Consistent, rational light sources. |
| Surface/Texture | **Realistic Rendering:** Faithful depiction of varied textures (cloth, flesh, stone, metal). Smooth, polished finish common in sculpture; nuanced blending possible with oil paint. |
| Figures         | **Anatomically Correct & Idealized:** Based on direct observation and study of classical models. Balanced, dynamic poses (*contrapposto*). Figures possess physical and psychological presence. (Northern: Often hyper-realistic detail. Mannerism: Elongated, stylized, artificial poses). |
| Space/Depth     | **Rational & Illusionistic:** Systematic use of **linear perspective** creates convincing three-dimensional space. **Atmospheric perspective** used for distant landscapes. Mathematical principles applied to spatial composition. |
| Color Palette   | Rich, harmonious colors often used. Balance and unity prioritized in High Renaissance (Raphael). Venetian school celebrated for rich color and light effects (*colorito*). Oil paint enables deep hues and subtle transitions. (Mannerism: Can feature vibrant, sometimes clashing, artificial colors). |
| Composition     | **Balanced & Ordered:** Often based on stable geometric forms (pyramids, circles). Symmetry, clear focal points, harmonious arrangement reflecting classical ideals of order and proportion. (Mannerism: Often asymmetrical, dynamic, crowded, complex 'serpentine' figures). |
| Details/Lines   | Emphasis on clear forms defined by drawing (*disegno*, esp. Florence/Rome) but integrated with three-dimensional modeling. Lines are often elegant and descriptive. (Northern: Extraordinary attention to minute detail). |
| **Mood/Emotion**| Generally conveys calm, dignity, grace, intellectual clarity, idealized beauty (High Renaissance). Exploration of human psychology and emotion within a naturalistic framework. (Mannerism: Can express anxiety, elegance, artifice, complexity). |
| **Subject Matter**| **Expansion:** Classical mythology, ancient history, secular portraiture, and allegory gain prominence alongside traditional Christian themes. The idealized or realistic human figure is central. Neo-Platonic philosophy influenced interpretations of classical and Christian subjects. |

**Key Phases & Regional Differences:**
* **Early Renaissance (Italy, c. 1400-1490s):** Experimental phase in Florence; development of perspective (Brunelleschi), revival of classical sculpture (Donatello), realistic painting (Masaccio).
* **High Renaissance (Italy, c. 1490s-1527):** Apex of classical ideals; synthesis of naturalism and idealism. Centered in Rome and Florence. Dominated by Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael.
* **Late Renaissance / Mannerism (Italy, c. 1520-1600):** Reaction against High Renaissance harmony; characterized by artifice, elegance, elongated forms, complex compositions, subjective expression.
* **Northern Renaissance (c. 1400s-1600):** Developed semi-independently in Flanders, Germany, etc. Emphasis on detailed realism, complex symbolism, mastery of oil painting (Van Eyck), printmaking (Dürer), genre scenes (Bruegel). Less direct focus on classical antiquity initially.
* **Venetian School:** Distinct Italian branch focused on color, light, and sensuous surfaces (Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese).

## Historical Context & Influences

The Renaissance was fueled by converging factors:
* Economic prosperity in Italian city-states (Florence, Venice, Genoa) through banking and trade, creating wealth for patronage.
* Rise of powerful merchant families (e.g., Medici in Florence) and ambitious Popes (e.g., Julius II, Leo X) who commissioned art to display power and piety.
* Renewed study of classical texts and philosophy (Humanism), often facilitated by Byzantine scholars fleeing the fall of Constantinople (1453).
* Scientific advancements and observation in anatomy, engineering, and optics.
* Invention of the printing press (mid-15th c.), which disseminated texts and images (like Dürer's prints) widely.
* The Age of Exploration expanded European horizons.
* Later impacted by the Protestant Reformation (challenging religious imagery, esp. in the North) and the Catholic Counter-Reformation (promoting art as a tool of faith).

**Influences:** Direct inspiration from **Classical Greek and Roman art, architecture, and literature**. Built upon the technical and artistic foundations of late **Gothic art**. Informed by **Humanist philosophy** and **scientific discoveries**.

## Key Artists & Their Contributions (Selected)

* **Italy:**
    * **Filippo Brunelleschi:** Architect (Florence Dome), codified linear perspective.
    * **Donatello:** Sculptor (realistic bronze *David*, powerful *Gattamelata*).
    * **Masaccio:** Painter (pioneering perspective & realism in Brancacci Chapel frescoes).
    * **Sandro Botticelli:** Painter (graceful linearity, mythological themes like *Birth of Venus*).

## Legacy and Influence

The Renaissance fundamentally reshaped Western art and culture:
* It established paradigms of naturalism, perspective, proportion, and beauty that dominated Western art for centuries.
* Elevated the role of the artist and emphasized human potential (humanism).
* Revived classical subject matter and integrated it with Christian themes.
* Developed and perfected techniques like oil painting and linear perspective.
* Its ideals were central to the formation of art academies and art theory.
* It directly led into subsequent styles like Baroque, which both built upon and reacted against Renaissance principles. Its influence remains potent in art, architecture, and broader cultural understanding.
