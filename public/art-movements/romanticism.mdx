## Overview & Key Characteristics

Romanticism was a sweeping artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement that emerged in the late 18th century and dominated the first half of the 19th century. Arising partly as a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and the perceived cold formality of Neoclassicism, Romanticism championed **emotion, intuition, imagination, individualism, and the profound power of nature**. It valued intense experience, subjectivity, and originality. Romantics were fascinated by the **sublime** (experiences evoking awe and terror, often related to nature's vastness), the **picturesque**, the **exotic**, the **medieval past**, folklore, national identity, and the extremes of human feeling – passion, horror, melancholy, heroism, and spiritual yearning. Landscape painting rose to unprecedented importance as a primary vehicle for expressing these complex emotions and ideas.

**Summary of Common Characteristics:**

| Feature         | Characteristic Description (Romanticism)                                                              |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light           | **Dramatic, Atmospheric, Symbolic:** Used to evoke mood – stormy skies, mystical moonlight, dramatic sunsets, divine radiance. Can be highly contrasted or softly diffused to create atmosphere (Turner, Friedrich). |
| Surface/Texture | **Expressive & Varied:** Often features visible, energetic brushwork conveying passion and movement (Delacroix). Can also involve meticulous detail to enhance realism or symbolism (Friedrich). Less emphasis on Neoclassical smoothness. |
| Figures         | **Emotional, Individualized, Often Vulnerable or Heroic:** Figures express intense feelings (awe, fear, longing, passion). Focus on the individual's inner state and response to events or nature. Less idealized, more psychologically complex than Neoclassical figures. |
| Space/Depth     | **Vast, Sublime, Mysterious, or Psychologically Charged:** Landscapes often emphasize immense scale, untamed nature, ruins, or atmospheric effects. Space used to evoke feelings of awe, insignificance, or confinement. Rejects Neoclassical clarity and order. |
| Color Palette   | **Rich, Evocative, Emotional:** Often uses intense, saturated colors, or subtle palettes to create specific moods. Color deployed for expressive and symbolic potential over purely descriptive accuracy. Strong light/dark contrasts common. |
| Composition     | **Dynamic, Asymmetrical, Dramatic:** Frequently employs diagonal lines, swirling movement, dramatic focal points, or compositions emphasizing vastness or isolation. Aims for emotional impact rather than classical stability. |
| Details/Lines   | **Subordinated to Emotion & Effect:** Line can be energetic, blurred, or used to define key symbolic details. Less emphasis on precise Neoclassical contours; atmosphere and overall feeling often prioritized. |
| **Mood/Emotion**| **Intense, Subjective, Emotional, Passionate, Sublime, Mysterious, Nostalgic, Heroic, Melancholic.** Focuses on awe (before nature/history), terror, longing, individualism, patriotism, spiritual searching, the power of dreams and the subconscious. |
| **Subject Matter**| **Nature (esp. wild, untamed, powerful), Landscapes (as mirror of the soul), The Sublime, Dramatic Historical/Literary Scenes (medieval, Shakespeare, contemporary struggles), Exotic Locales ('Orientalism'), The Supernatural/Macabre, Dreams & Nightmares, National Identity & Folklore, Individual Experience & Suffering.** |

Romanticism celebrated the power of feeling, imagination, and nature over rationalism and convention.

## Historical Context & Influences

Romanticism emerged and flourished during a period of profound transformation:
* **Reaction to Enlightenment & Neoclassicism:** A desire for emotion, intuition, and spirituality in response to the perceived limitations of pure reason and classical order.
* **Age of Revolutions:** The American and French Revolutions, followed by the Napoleonic Wars, inspired ideals of liberty, heroism, and nationalism, but also brought awareness of violence and suffering.
* **Industrial Revolution:** Beginning in Britain, industrialization started altering landscapes and society, leading some Romantics to idealize nature and pre-industrial life.
* **Nationalism:** Growing sense of national identity across Europe, fueled by Napoleonic conquests and interest in local history, language, and folklore.
* **Exploration & Colonialism:** Increased contact with non-European cultures fueled fascination with the "exotic" and distant lands.

**Influences:** Reacted against **Neoclassicism**. Drew inspiration from the dynamism and emotion of the **Baroque** (e.g., Rubens). Influenced by philosophers like **Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (emphasis on nature and feeling) and German Idealists (**Kant, Schelling**). Found inspiration in literature (medieval epics, **Shakespeare**, contemporary poets like **Byron, Shelley, Keats, Goethe, Schiller**). A renewed appreciation for **Gothic architecture** and **medieval history**.

## Key Artists & Their Contributions

* **Britain:**
    * **J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851):** Master of landscape and seascape; explored the sublime, power of nature, effects of light and atmosphere with near-abstract energy.
    * **John Constable (1776-1837):** Painted the English countryside with deep affection and close observation of natural effects, influencing French landscape painting.
    * **William Blake (1757-1827):** Visionary poet, painter, printmaker; created intensely personal mythological and religious imagery.
    * **Henry Fuseli (1741-1825):** Swiss-British painter known for exploring the dark, irrational side of the human psyche (dreams, nightmares, supernatural).
* **Germany:** **Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840):** Leading painter of German Romanticism; created evocative landscapes imbued with spiritual symbolism, often featuring contemplative figures.
* **France:**
    * **Théodore Géricault (1791-1824):** Known for dramatic intensity, realism applied to contemporary events (*Raft of the Medusa*).
    * **Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863):** Leader of French Romantic painting; famed for rich color (colorito), dynamic compositions, and dramatic historical/exotic subjects (*Liberty Leading the People*).
* **Spain:** **Francisco Goya (1746-1828):** Towering figure whose later work embodies Romantic themes of war's horror, social critique, psychological darkness, and the breakdown of reason (*The Third of May 1808*, *Black Paintings*).
* **United States:** **Thomas Cole (1801-1848):** Founder of the Hudson River School, painting the American wilderness as both sublime and capable of allegorical meaning.

## Notable Works / Sites

* **Painting:** Friedrich, *Wanderer above the Sea of Fog*; Turner, *Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps*, *The Fighting Temeraire*; Constable, *The Hay Wain*, *Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows*; Géricault, *Raft of the Medusa*; Delacroix, *Liberty Leading the People*, *Death of Sardanapalus*; Goya, *The Third of May 1808*, *Saturn Devouring His Son*; Blake, *Newton*.
* **Sculpture:** François Rude, *Departure of the Volunteers of 1792 (La Marseillaise)* (Arc de Triomphe, Paris); Antoine-Louis Barye (animal sculptures).
* **Architecture:** While less central, the Gothic Revival style (e.g., Houses of Parliament, London; Neuschwanstein Castle, Bavaria) reflects Romantic fascination with the medieval past. Picturesque landscape design also flourished.

## Legacy and Influence

Romanticism marked a fundamental shift in Western consciousness and artistic practice:
* It validated emotion, intuition, and individual experience as primary artistic sources.
* Made landscape and depictions of nature major vehicles for expressing profound ideas and feelings.
* Championed artistic freedom, originality, and expressive techniques (e.g., visible brushwork, intense color).
* Its exploration of nationalism, history, psychology, and the sublime opened up vast new territories for art.
* It laid the groundwork for subsequent movements, including Realism (partly a reaction against Romantic excesses), Symbolism (inheriting its focus on imagination and subjective states), and Expressionism (intensifying its emotionalism). The Romantic emphasis on the individual artist and the power of feeling continues to be influential.
