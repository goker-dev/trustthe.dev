## Overview & Key Characteristics

Impressionism was a revolutionary art movement that emerged in France in the 1860s and 1870s, marking a significant departure from academic tradition. Its central aim was to capture the **immediate visual impression** of a scene, particularly the **transient effects of light and color**. To achieve this, Impressionist painters often worked **outdoors (*en plein air*)**, allowing them to directly observe and record the changing conditions of light and atmosphere. They favored subjects drawn from **modern life**—landscapes, cityscapes, suburban scenes, portraits, and depictions of middle-class leisure. Characterized by **loose, broken brushwork**, a **bright, vibrant palette**, and compositions influenced by photography and Japanese prints, Impressionism sought to convey sensory experience over detailed description. The movement famously took its name from a critique of Claude Monet's painting *Impression, Sunrise* when a group of artists, rejected by the official Salon, organized their own independent exhibition in 1874.

**Summary of Common Characteristics:**

| Feature         | Characteristic Description (Impressionism)                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light           | **Paramount Importance:** Focus on capturing the specific quality and changing effects of natural light and atmosphere at a particular moment. How light reflects, refracts, and dissolves forms. |
| Surface/Texture | **Visible, Broken Brushwork:** Often uses short, quick, distinct strokes of color that convey immediacy and vibration. Texture of paint application is often evident; finish is rarely smooth. |
| Figures         | Depicted as part of the scene, affected by light. Often shown in candid moments of modern leisure or work. Form suggested by light/color patches rather than precise anatomical detail (Degas is an exception, emphasizing line). |
| Space/Depth     | Often conveyed through color relationships, atmospheric effects, overlapping planes, and sometimes high viewpoints or cropped compositions. Less reliance on traditional linear perspective; can appear relatively flat. |
| Color Palette   | **Bright, Vibrant, Pure:** Emphasis on capturing colored light. Use of pure, often unblended colors applied side-by-side for optical mixing by the viewer. Avoidance of black; shadows rendered with color (blues, violets). |
| Composition     | **Often Asymmetrical, Cropped, Spontaneous-seeming:** Influenced by Japanese woodblock prints and photography. Captures a "slice of life" feel, rejecting rigid academic compositional formulas. |
| Details/Lines   | Specific details often subordinated to the overall impression of light, color, and atmosphere. Form defined more by color and light than by strong, clear outlines (Degas being a notable exception). |
| **Mood/Emotion**| Generally **Bright, Cheerful, Optimistic, Objective (in perception).** Captures the pleasant sensations of modern life, leisure activities, the beauty of nature, and urban dynamism. Less focused on deep psychological drama or social critique. |
| **Subject Matter**| **Modern Life & Nature:** Landscapes, seascapes, cityscapes (Parisian boulevards, train stations), suburban gardens, scenes of leisure (boating, cafes, dances, opera), domestic interiors, informal portraits. Everyday, contemporary world. |

## Historical Context & Influences

Impressionism developed during a time of significant social and technological change in France:
* **Second Empire & Third Republic:** A period of modernization, industrial growth, and changing social structures.
* **Haussmann's Renovation of Paris:** Created wide boulevards, parks, and cafes that became key subjects for Impressionists, reflecting new patterns of urban life and leisure.
* **Rise of the Middle Class:** Provided both subject matter (leisure activities) and patronage.
* **Technological Developments:** Availability of pre-packaged paints in tubes made *plein air* painting more practical. Photography influenced compositional choices (cropping, capturing motion).

**Influences:** Impressionism built upon several key sources:
* **Realism:** Inherited focus on contemporary life and rejection of academic subjects (Courbet, Manet - who was a crucial inspiration and mentor figure).
* **Barbizon School:** Landscape painters (Corot, Rousseau, Daubigny) who emphasized direct observation of nature and *plein air* sketching.
* **Japanese Woodblock Prints (*Japonisme*):** Provided models for asymmetrical compositions, flat areas of color, unconventional viewpoints, and focus on everyday scenes.
* **Color Theory:** Emerging scientific understanding of optics and color influenced techniques like optical mixing.
* **Eugène Boudin:** Mentor to Monet, encouraged painting outdoors and capturing atmospheric effects.

## Key Artists & Their Contributions

* **Claude Monet (1840-1926):** The archetypal Impressionist, dedicated to capturing fleeting effects of light and atmosphere, often painting the same subject in series under different conditions (*Impression, Sunrise*, *Haystacks*, *Rouen Cathedral*, *Water Lilies*).
* **Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919):** Celebrated for depicting figures, particularly women and children, in scenes of leisure and intimacy, often with dappled light and sensuous brushwork (*Bal du moulin de la Galette*, *Luncheon of the Boating Party*).
* **Edgar Degas (1834-1917):** Focused on figures in motion, particularly dancers, bathers, and racehorses. Master of drawing and composition, often worked in the studio, using pastels frequently. Known for innovative perspectives (*The Dance Class*, *L'Absinthe*).
* **Camille Pissarro (1830-1903):** A central figure who exhibited in all eight Impressionist shows. Known for landscapes, rural scenes, and later vibrant cityscapes. Influential teacher and mentor.
* **Berthe Morisot (1841-1895):** A leading female Impressionist known for her fluid brushwork and intimate portrayals of women and domestic life (*The Cradle*).
* **Mary Cassatt (1844-1926):** American artist active with the Impressionists in Paris. Focused on the social and private lives of women, particularly the bond between mothers and children (*The Child's Bath*).
* **Alfred Sisley (1839-1899):** Dedicated landscape painter, consistently worked *en plein air* to capture the subtleties of light and atmosphere in the French countryside.
* **Gustave Caillebotte (1848-1894):** Known for his depictions of modern Paris with striking perspectives; also an important patron and organizer for the group (*Paris Street; Rainy Day*).

## Notable Works

* Monet: *Impression, Sunrise*, *Gare Saint-Lazare*, *Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son*, *Water Lilies* series.
* Renoir: *Bal du moulin de la Galette*, *Luncheon of the Boating Party*, *Dance at Bougival*.
* Degas: *The Dance Class*, *L'Absinthe*, *Woman Bathing in a Shallow Tub*, *Little Dancer of Fourteen Years* (sculpture).
* Pissarro: *Gelée Blanche (White Frost)*, *Boulevard Montmartre* series.
* Morisot: *The Cradle*, *Summer's Day*.
* Cassatt: *The Child's Bath*, *Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge*.
* Caillebotte: *Paris Street; Rainy Day*, *The Floor Scrapers*.

## Legacy and Influence

Impressionism fundamentally altered the course of modern art:
* It shifted the focus of painting from detailed objective representation to capturing subjective visual perception and sensation.
* Prioritized light and color as expressive tools in their own right.
* Normalized painting *en plein air* and depicting everyday modern life.
* Its revolutionary techniques and approach directly inspired Post-Impressionism (Cézanne, Seurat, Van Gogh, Gauguin sought to build upon or react against it) and subsequent movements like Fauvism and Abstract Expressionism.
* Impressionism remains one of the most beloved and widely recognized art movements globally.
