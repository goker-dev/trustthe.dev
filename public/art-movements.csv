1,Prehistoric Art,"~40,000–3,000 BCE",Anonymous,Lascaux Cave Paintings (France) (Cave Wall Painting),"Understanding nature, struggle for survival, coping with unknown forces, community bonds.","Survival, Forces of Nature, Ritual, First Symbols, Clan/Community Identity.","Use a Prehistoric Art approach based on Upper Paleolithic cave paintings. Focus on simplified, primal visual language characterized by strong contour lines, abstract human figures (schematic or stick-like), and symbolic representations. Emphasize rough, spontaneous application techniques such as dabbing, blowing pigments, and engraving lines into a textured rock surface. Natural earth pigments — ochres, charcoals, and manganese — dominate the limited color palette. Integrate the irregularities and textures of the rock wall into the composition to achieve an organic, raw aesthetic.","Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution). Use flat, indeterminate lighting without a discernible source to maintain the prehistoric cave environment feeling. Employ a direct, frontal or slight profile view, preserving the visual flatness typical of cave art. Simulate the rough, uneven rock surface texture as the canvas, allowing it to interact naturally with the figures. Avoid realistic anatomy, perspective, smooth surfaces, complex shading, or detailed architectural elements. Figures should appear scattered, isolated, or loosely clustered without formal composition or ground lines, reflecting the opportunistic, timeless nature of prehistoric wall art.","Depict a dynamic prehistoric hunting scene where a coordinated group of simplified human figures actively engages in the pursuit of a massive bison or similar large animal. Emphasize the primal urgency and collaborative nature of the hunt, highlighting the immense size and raw power of the prey. Position the human figures in energetic, purposeful stances that convey tension and motion, utilizing rhythmic repetition or patterned arrangements to suggest the ritualistic and symbolic importance of the hunt in early human survival culture. The setting should evoke a wild, untamed natural landscape, reinforcing the elemental relationship between humans and large fauna.","Convey a vivid blend of primal tension, ritualistic reverence, and the existential urgency of survival. Capture the awe-inspiring scale of nature, the determined spirit of human cooperation, and the timeless emotional weight carried by the ancient struggle for life. Balance intensity and sacredness, evoking both the fierce energy of the hunt and the spiritual significance it held within prehistoric communities."
2,Ancient Egyptian Art,"~3,500 BCE–300 CE",Anonymous,"Tomb of Nebamun Frescoes (e.g., Garden Scene) (Wall Painting/Fresco)","Death and the afterlife, maintaining order against chaos, legitimacy of divine authority, sustaining life.","Quest for Immortality, Divine Order (Ma'at), Sacred Authority, Eternity, Protection/Preservation.","Use the Ancient Egyptian art style characterized by figures depicted in composite view — head and limbs shown in profile, eye and torso shown frontally. Apply strong, clear outlines around figures and objects, and fill enclosed areas with flat, solid colors without shading or blending. Utilize a limited earth-based color palette including Red Ochre, Yellow Ochre, Carbon Black, Gypsum White, Egyptian Blue, and Malachite Green. Arrange figures formally along horizontal baselines, often organized into registers (horizontal bands) to structure the scene. Prioritize clarity, symbolism, and conceptual space, avoiding realistic depth, shading, or perspective.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting, avoiding any depiction of shadows or light sources. Maintain a direct, straight-on view that emphasizes the two-dimensional, stylized nature of the composition. Figures should conform to the composite view convention, arranged along baselines or within structured registers. The setting should simulate an Ancient Egyptian decorated surface such as a tomb wall, temple wall, or papyrus scroll, potentially featuring stylized environmental motifs like papyrus reeds or geometric Egyptian framing patterns.","Visualize a meticulously ordered scene depicting a pharaoh presiding over a religious ritual or overseeing a monumental construction project. Emphasize hierarchical scale, with the pharaoh significantly larger than other figures. Utilize the conventional Egyptian composite view (profile head, frontal torso, profile limbs) and clear, symbolic representations of deities or hieroglyphic texts that underscore the divine order (Ma'at) and the pharaoh's role in maintaining it. The setting should convey permanence and stability, perhaps within a tomb or temple context, rendered with durable materials and precise lines.","Evoke a sense of eternal stability, divine order, and profound reverence for the sacred. Convey the power and legitimacy of the pharaoh, the certainty of the afterlife, and the harmonious relationship between humanity, the gods, and the cosmos. The overall feeling should be one of serene confidence, solemnity, and unwavering belief in the established cosmic and political structure."
3,Ancient Greek Art,"~1,600 BCE–31 BCE",Exekias (Vase Painter),Achilles and Ajax Playing Dice (Black-figure Vase Painting),"Man's place in the universe, search for ideal beauty and governance, reason-emotion balance, fate.","Human Ideal, Reason and Logic, Beauty and Harmony, Measure/Proportion, Democracy/Citizenship, Myth.","Use the Ancient Greek black-figure vase painting style, particularly from the Archaic period. Figures are depicted as solid black silhouettes against the natural red-orange clay background. Details such as musculature, hair, and drapery folds are incised through the black slip before firing, revealing the clay color beneath. Additional details may be added using added red and white paint. Figures are often arranged along a ground line, compositions are balanced and adapted to the vase shape, prioritizing narrative clarity and decorative effect. Anatomy becomes more naturalistic during the Archaic period compared to earlier Geometric styles, but figures remain somewhat stylized, often in profile or composite views. Avoid volumetric shading and realistic perspective.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) under neutral, even lighting that clearly reveals the painted surface without casting strong shadows. Maintain a direct view that focuses on the two-dimensional composition of the vase, respecting the curvature but emphasizing the flat design. Depict figures dynamically and elegantly within the confines of the red-figure technique, avoiding realistic spatial depth, shading, modern rendering effects, or expanded color palettes. Keep the visual presentation consistent with authentic Ancient Greek terracotta pottery display contexts.","Depict an idealized athletic figure or a mythological hero captured in a moment of balanced action or poised contemplation (e.g., using contrapposto). Focus on anatomical accuracy, harmonious proportions, and the potential of the human form. Alternatively, visualize a scene from mythology rendered with clarity and narrative focus on a vase. Emphasize the rational structure, balance, and idealized beauty reflecting Greek philosophical values. The forms should feel both naturalistic and perfected, embodying the pursuit of human excellence (areté).","Inspire admiration for human potential, intellectual clarity, and idealized beauty. Evoke a sense of balance, harmony, order, and rational control. Capture the dignity of the human form and the celebration of human achievement, whether physical, intellectual, or civic. In later periods, aim for increased pathos and dramatic tension while retaining underlying classical ideals."
4,Ancient Roman Art,~500 BCE–476 CE,Anonymous,Garden Landscape from the Villa of Livia (Wall Painting/Fresco),"Governing the empire, representing power, maintaining order, practical solutions, historical memory.","Power, Empire, Law/Order, Pragmatism, Historical Monument/Monumentality.","Use the Ancient Roman fresco painting style characterized by realistic depiction of figures and settings, with a strong emphasis on verism in portraiture. Apply chiaroscuro modeling to create three-dimensional volume and use illusionistic techniques, such as linear and atmospheric perspective, to suggest spatial depth. Utilize a rich, varied color palette including Pompeian Reds, yellows, greens, blues, blacks, and whites for naturalistic representation. Ensure a smooth, polished fresco surface with detailed painted textures representing materials like marble, fabric, and foliage. Favor dynamic, complex compositions framed by architectural elements, while avoiding flatness, heavy outlines, stylization, and photorealism.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using naturalistic lighting depicted within the painted scene to model forms and convey realistic volume. Adopt an eye-level perspective to reinforce the illusion of depth, employing architectural framing and perspective techniques typical of Roman wall paintings. Maintain a smooth, fresco-like finish, avoiding visible brushstrokes or impasto. Frame the narrative with painted architectural elements such as columns, arches, or garden landscapes, and steer clear of medieval stylistic conventions, gold backgrounds, and purely symbolic or cartoonish representations.","Present a realistic (veristic) portrait bust of a Roman patrician, emphasizing individual likeness, age, and character, conveying dignity and civic virtue. Alternatively, depict a grand architectural space like an aqueduct or amphitheater, showcasing engineering prowess and the scale of the Empire. Or, visualize a historical relief carving narrating a military victory or imperial ceremony, functioning as state propaganda. The emphasis should be on power, pragmatism, realism, and the documentation of history and authority.","Evoke feelings of awe towards imperial power, respect for authority and tradition, and civic pride. Convey the gravity, stability, and organizational might of the Roman state. In portraiture, elicit a sense of encountering a real, distinct individual with specific character traits and social standing. Instill confidence in the enduring strength and historical significance of Rome."
5,Early Christian & Byzantine Art,~250/300 CE–1453 CE,Anonymous,"San Vitale Basilica, Ravenna - Empress Theodora Mosaic (Mosaic)","Spiritual quest against the material world, representing the unseen, protecting faith, religious authority.","Spirituality, Divine Representation, Belief in Salvation, Faith and Dogma, Escape from Material, Holy Empire.","Adopt the Early Christian and Byzantine Art aesthetic. Focus on spiritual and symbolic representation rather than naturalistic portrayal. Render human figures as elongated, slender, and ethereal forms, positioned frontally or near-frontally with large, iconic eyes. Maintain flattened spatial treatment, avoiding realistic depth or perspective. Use strong dark outlines to define distinct color areas. Employ a luminous gold background to symbolize the divine realm, surrounding figures with an aura of sacred light. Stylize drapery with linear, pattern-like folds rather than realistic flow. Hierarchical scale should be applied, emphasizing important figures. The surface texture should emulate the shimmering, uneven quality of glass mosaics.","Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with ambient lighting that enhances the shimmering, luminous effect of the mosaic. Use a direct, frontal view, slightly tilted upward as if viewing a grand apse or dome mosaic. Maintain a flat, non-spatial composition dominated by gold and colored glass tesserae textures. Focus on stylized, iconic presentation without depth, shadows, or realistic environmental details, keeping the visual language strictly spiritual and formal.","Visualize a scene from the life of Christ or saints depicted with flat, elongated figures against a gold, ethereal background (often in mosaic or fresco). Emphasize symbolic meaning over realistic representation; figures should appear otherworldly and communicate spiritual truths. Focus on hierarchical arrangements, frontal poses, large eyes conveying spiritual intensity, and symbolic gestures or attributes. The scene should function as a visual aid for teaching faith and inspiring devotion, directing the viewer's mind away from the material world towards the divine.","Inspire spiritual awe, piety, reverence, and contemplation of the divine mysteries. Evoke a sense of the sacred, the transcendent, and detachment from earthly concerns. Convey the solemnity of religious narratives and the authority of the Church and Christianized Empire. Foster a feeling of spiritual connection through iconic imagery meant to serve as windows to the sacred realm."
6,Romanesque Art,~1000 CE–1200 CE,Anonymous,Sant Climent de Taüll Apse Fresco (Spain) (Wall Painting/Fresco),"Fear of God, sin and salvation, power of the Church, insecurity of the feudal world.","Divine Judgment, Sin and Penance, Church Authority, Protection/Refuge, Pilgrimage.","Adopt the Romanesque Art style (approx. 10th–12th centuries). Figures are simplified, heavy, and solid, emphasizing symbolic meaning over naturalistic representation. Human forms appear blocky, stiff, and often frontal, with large hands, feet, and heads to enhance narrative clarity. Drapery folds are stylized into rhythmic, linear, and simple patterns. Use strong, dark outlines to separate areas of color. Spatial treatment is flat and shallow, avoiding realistic perspective or depth. Backgrounds typically feature solid color fields or simple decorative motifs (geometric patterns, symbolic plants) instead of realistic landscapes. Hierarchical scale is applied to emphasize the importance of figures. Surface treatment is matte, earthy, and raw, with no luminous or reflective elements.","Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution). Lighting should be ambient and interior, but neutral and soft, not highlighting specific sources. There is no shimmering or glowing effect; instead, surfaces should appear matte and earth-toned, as if painted on plaster walls (fresco technique) or stone surfaces. Use a direct, frontal view; figures should be posed stiffly and symmetrically, emphasizing narrative clarity and hierarchical scale. Colors must be applied flatly, inside strong outlines, without shading, blending, or atmospheric depth. Maintain a sense of formal balance but allow a static, monumental feeling typical of Romanesque iconography.","Illustrate a scene from the Last Judgment carved in high relief on the tympanum above a church doorway. Depict Christ enthroned, surrounded by angels and apostles, with clear divisions between the saved and the damned below. Use stylized, elongated figures with clear gestures conveying narrative and moral lessons. The composition should feel solid, ordered, and somewhat severe, emphasizing the authority of the Church and the weighty themes of judgment and salvation within a massive, fortress-like architectural setting.","Evoke a sense of religious awe, reverence for divine authority, and perhaps fear of judgment. Convey the seriousness of Christian doctrine and the stability and protective power of the Church in an uncertain world. The overall feeling should be one of solemnity, didactic clarity, and enduring faith."
7,Gothic Art,~1150 CE–1500 CE,Limbourg Brothers,"""Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry"" (Manuscript/Miniature)","Desire to reach God, uniting faith and reason, rise of cities, personal piety.","Divine Light, Ascent/Transcendence, Faith and Reason (Scholasticism), Urban Identity/Pride.","Use the Gothic stained glass style characterized by luminous, jewel-like colors — deep blues, ruby reds, emerald greens, golden yellows, and violets — separated by strong black outlines simulating lead came. Depict slender, elongated, and elegant figures with stylized drapery folds and slight S-curve poses. Emphasize decorative, vertical compositions with narrative panel divisions and Gothic architectural tracery. Avoid realistic 3D depth, smooth color blending, photorealism, and Renaissance or Baroque anatomical realism.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with a backlit glow effect to simulate transmitted light through colored glass. Maintain a direct, front-on view, optionally with a slight upward angle, highlighting the flatness of the stained glass surface. Frame the composition within Gothic stone tracery such as pointed arches, rose window patterns, or mullions. Preserve the clarity of lead line structures and the vibrancy of jewel-toned colors without introducing smooth gradients or realistic shading, maintaining the luminous narrative tradition of Gothic windows.","Visualize the interior of a soaring Gothic cathedral, emphasizing verticality, ribbed vaults, pointed arches, and vast expanses of stained glass. Depict light filtering through the colored glass, creating an ethereal, transcendent atmosphere. Figures in sculpture or glass should appear more naturalistic than Romanesque examples but still serve a primarily spiritual purpose, perhaps depicting saints or biblical narratives that draw the eye upwards towards the heavens.","Inspire feelings of spiritual uplift, awe, wonder, and transcendence. Create a sense of being enveloped in divine light and reaching towards heaven. Foster emotional engagement with religious stories through increased naturalism while maintaining a focus on piety, devotion, and the grandeur of God."
8,Renaissance Art,~1400 CE–1600 CE,Leonardo da Vinci,Mona Lisa (Oil Painting),"Centrality of man, discovery of the individual, understanding the world through observation, synthesis of antiquity and Christianity.","Humanism, Individualism, Scientific Observation, Return to Ancient Ideals, Human Potential, Perspective.","Use the Renaissance art style characterized by idealized naturalism, realistic human anatomy, and mastery of linear perspective to create rational, ordered space. Apply chiaroscuro lighting to model forms and add depth. Employ a rich, harmonious, and naturalistic color palette blending deep reds, blues, yellows, greens, and realistic flesh tones. Ensure smooth surface finishes with subtle transitions and detailed rendering of materials such as fabric and skin. Favor balanced, pyramidal, or symmetrical compositions. Avoid flatness, abstraction, heavy outlines, photorealism, and exaggerated anatomical distortions.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using soft, directional lighting to enhance three-dimensional volume. Use an eye-level or slightly low-angle perspective to reinforce realistic spatial depth through linear perspective techniques. Compose the scene within an idealized natural landscape or architecturally ordered background. Maintain a smooth, painterly finish with careful blending and fine detail work, avoiding modern art styles, cartoon-like simplifications, or primitive visual conventions.","Depict a scene like Raphael's ""School of Athens,"" showcasing classical architecture rendered with linear perspective, filled with realistically proportioned figures representing philosophers and thinkers. Emphasize balance, harmony, and the integration of classical learning with contemporary humanist ideals. Figures should display naturalistic anatomy, drapery, and individualized, emotionally resonant expressions, celebrating human intellect and potential.","Evoke admiration for human reason, idealized beauty, harmony, and intellectual achievement. Foster a sense of order, clarity, and profound respect for both classical antiquity and human potential. Connect the viewer emotionally through the realistic portrayal of human psychology and interaction, aiming for grace and dignity."
9,Mannerism,~1520 CE–1600 CE,Parmigianino,Madonna with the Long Neck (Oil Painting),"Post-Renaissance crisis and uncertainty, nature of art, internal conflicts, sophisticated tastes.","Uncertainty/Restlessness, Artificiality/Stylization, Complexity, Internal Conflict, Elegance.","Elongate human figures with small heads and contorted, serpentine poses ('figura serpentinata'). Use an artificial, intense, iridescent color palette — acid greens, electric blues, sharp pinks, and bright oranges — emphasizing decorative effect over naturalism. Create crowded, asymmetrical, and spatially ambiguous compositions with intricate details and smooth, polished surfaces. Avoid realistic proportions, harmonious balance, naturalistic colors, and stable, rational perspectives.","Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with theatrical, sharp lighting that heightens the tension and artifice. Use dynamic, tilted, or compressed viewpoints to accentuate the twisted poses and ambiguous space. The background should suggest an abstract, shallow setting — luxurious props or undefined environments that prioritize composition over realism. Maintain a refined, polished finish with intricate textural details, steering clear of naturalistic lighting, stable eye-level views, or rough, textured brushwork.","Visualize a religious or mythological scene featuring elongated figures in complex, artificial, serpentine poses (figura serpentinata). Utilize unusual, perhaps acidic color harmonies and ambiguous or compressed spatial arrangements. The composition should prioritize elegance, virtuosity, and intellectual sophistication over naturalism, creating a ""stylish style"" that departs intentionally from Renaissance balance.","Create a feeling of elegance, sophistication, artifice, and sometimes tension or anxiety. Evoke intellectual intrigue rather than direct emotional empathy. Convey a sense of deliberate distortion and stylistic self-consciousness, reflecting the era's complexities and challenging classical norms with sophisticated, often unsettling beauty."
10,Baroque Art,~1600 CE–1750 CE,Caravaggio,The Calling of Saint Matthew (Oil Painting),"Need to influence the masses (religious/political), appealing to the senses, displaying the splendor of power.","Persuasion/Propaganda, Emotional Intensity, Movement and Drama, Absolute Power, Infinity/Transcendence.","Use strong chiaroscuro and tenebrism lighting to create deep shadows and brilliant highlights. Favor rich, saturated colors like deep reds, golds, dark greens, and deep blues, contrasted with luminous creams and sharp blacks. Composition should be dynamic, swirling, and full of movement — using strong diagonals, dramatic foreshortening, and ornate detail. Figures should be realistic, sensuous, caught mid-action or emotional climax. Avoid flat lighting, calmness, pale or pastel colors, and static or symmetrical compositions.","Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with dramatic, focused lighting to enhance the three-dimensionality and emotional tension. Use low or oblique camera angles to amplify the dynamism and theatricality. The setting can be a turbulent natural landscape or a dark, undefined background isolating the figures. Simulate oil painting with rich glazing and optional impasto textures for depth. Prioritize emotional immediacy, movement, grandeur, and ornate decorative richness, steering clear of serene, minimalist, or symmetrical approaches.","Depict a dramatic moment of religious ecstasy or martyrdom, like Bernini's ""Ecstasy of Saint Teresa,"" using dynamic movement, intense contrast of light and shadow (chiaroscuro), and rich textures. Emphasize theatricality and direct engagement with the viewer. The composition should feel energetic, ornate, and emotionally charged, designed to overwhelm the senses and convey spiritual fervor or power.","Evoke strong emotions: awe, wonder, intense piety, spiritual transport, drama, passion, or even shock. Aim to directly involve the viewer emotionally and spiritually, making the depicted event feel immediate and powerful. Convey a sense of grandeur, dynamism, and the sensuous splendor of the divine or the powerful."
11,Rococo Art,~1730 CE–1770 CE,Jean-Honoré Fragonard,The Swing (Oil Painting),"Aristocracy's final pleasures, sensing impending change, search for intimacy vs. artificiality.","Pleasure and Entertainment, Lightness/Transience, Sensuality, Social Rituals, Aristocratic Elegance.","Use the elegant Rococo style characterized by a light, airy pastel color palette — soft pinks, light blues, mint greens, creamy yellows, and ivory, accented with gold and silver. Favor asymmetrical, dynamic compositions enriched with S-curves, C-curves, and ornamental scrollwork (""rocaille""). Employ graceful, delicate figure rendering with smooth porcelain-like textures and feathery, refined brushwork. Maintain an overall atmosphere of lightness, charm, playfulness, and intimacy. Avoid dark, dramatic shadows, heavy forms, and stark emotional intensity — emphasizing elegance, decorative finesse, and fluidity.","Render the scene in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with soft, diffused, luminous lighting, avoiding harsh shadows. Set the composition within an intimate, ornate environment, such as a Rococo-style garden or salon, featuring graceful curves and intricate decorative elements. Simulate the surface texture of oil on canvas or delicate pastel drawings, ensuring a smooth, blended finish. Avoid heavy, gritty realism, rigid symmetry, or minimalist austerity, maintaining a feeling of elegance, lightness, and fluid sophistication. Reimagine this prehistoric scene in the elegant Rococo style.","Depict an intimate gathering of elegantly dressed aristocrats engaged in lighthearted flirtation or leisurely pursuits within a sumptuously decorated salon or an idyllic garden setting.

Focus on strong, precise drawing with clear contours and well-defined forms, prioritizing line over color. Depict figures with emotional restraint, calmness, and statuesque poses, often clothed in classical drapery or idealized nudity. Surfaces should be smooth and highly finished with minimal visible brushwork. The color palette should be restrained yet strong, utilizing rich reds, deep blues, stark whites, ochres, greys, subdued greens, and earthy browns, avoiding Rococo pastels and Baroque dramatic contrasts.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with soft, even lighting that models forms subtly without dramatic shadows or chiaroscuro. Use a stable, ordered composition, favoring symmetrical or horizontally aligned arrangements resembling classical friezes. Figures should be parallel to the picture plane, arranged in a shallow, clearly defined spatial field. Maintain a polished, almost sculptural finish that emphasizes clarity of form and rational structure, steering clear of dynamic angles, fluid poses, atmospheric depth, or expressive brushstrokes.","Visualize a scene from Roman history, like David's ""Oath of the Horatii,"" emphasizing civic virtue, self-sacrifice, and rationality. Employ clear, sharp lines, balanced composition, subdued colors, and sculptural figures inspired by classical statuary. The setting should be austere and ordered, reflecting archaeological accuracy where possible. The narrative should convey a strong moral or patriotic message with clarity and gravity.","Inspire feelings of patriotism, civic virtue, rationality, seriousness, and moral clarity. Evoke admiration for heroism, self-restraint, and duty.

Depict nature as powerful, wild, and untamed, often dwarfing human figures or reflecting human moods. Employ dynamic, turbulent, or evocative scenes that convey awe, terror, passion, or melancholy. Utilize expressive, visible brushwork with glazing, scumbling, or impasto techniques to build atmospheric effects. Favor rich, evocative color palettes with deep blues, stormy grays, intense reds, earthy greens, golden lights, and misty whites. Focus on light's emotional impact, such as sunsets, storms, or fog, avoiding rigid classical order or restraint.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with dramatic, mood-enhancing lighting, employing chiaroscuro effects to heighten emotional tension. Compose scenes dynamically and asymmetrically, using strong diagonals, swirling movements, or vast natural expanses. Create a sense of atmosphere with visible texture and brushwork, emphasizing elements like mist, storm clouds, water surfaces, or rugged terrain. Avoid classical symmetry, flat perspectives, or clean, polished finishes — instead favor expressive depth, emotional resonance, and an immersive, sublime experience.","Depict a lone figure confronting the awesome power of nature (the sublime), such as Friedrich's ""Wanderer above the Sea of Fog,"" or a dramatic historical or exotic scene filled with intense action and feeling. Utilize dynamic compositions, rich or turbulent color, and expressive brushwork. The emphasis should be on individual experience, imagination, intuition, and the overwhelming forces of nature or human passion.","Evoke strong emotions such as awe, wonder, terror, passion, melancholy, longing, or heroic struggle. Aim to capture the intensity of individual subjective experience and the power of the untamed natural world or human imagination.

14,Realism,~1840 CE–1900 CE,Gustave Courbet,The Stone Breakers (Oil Painting),"Social injustices, condition of the working class, showing reality as it is, role of art.","Social Reality/Naked Truth, Claim of Objectivity, Class Differences, Everyday Life.","Use the Realism style characterized by accurate, objective, and unidealized depictions of everyday life and ordinary subjects. Focus on direct observation and truthfulness to reality, portraying figures honestly with visible signs of labor, age, or social class. Avoid historical, mythological, exotic, or overly sentimental themes. Employ naturalistic, often somber or earthy color palettes featuring browns, greys, muted greens, dull blues, realistic flesh tones, and dark or off-white shades. Brushwork should support representational goals without expressive exaggeration, emphasizing accurate textures like rough fabric, worn surfaces, or natural environments.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with naturalistic, direct lighting that accurately reveals forms and textures without dramatic effects. Use straightforward, honest compositions that prioritize clarity and realism over academic idealism or theatrical drama. Depict scenes with solidity and simplicity, avoiding complex structures or dynamic movements.

Apply short, visible brushstrokes and place pure, often unmixed colors side-by-side for optical mixing. Depict scenes with vibrant luminosity, avoiding black for shadows and using blues, purples, and complementary tones instead. Favor spontaneity and immediacy over precise contours or detailed rendering. Emphasize the shimmering quality of light with energetic surface textures and a bright, lively palette including bright blues, vibrant greens, sunny yellows, oranges, pinks, and violets.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using natural, diffused lighting that enhances color vibrancy without creating deep shadows. Compose scenes informally and spontaneously, with asymmetrical balance, open compositions, and occasional unconventional cropping or viewpoints. Maintain an airy, fresh feel in the arrangement, suggesting a snapshot of life or a fleeting outdoor moment. Allow visible brushwork and color interactions to form the impression rather than relying on detailed linework or rigid forms, steering away from photorealistic clarity or heavy modeling.","Capture the fleeting visual sensation of a specific moment outdoors, like Monet painting haystacks or a bustling Parisian street scene. Emphasize the changing effects of light and atmosphere using visible, broken brushstrokes and pure, unmixed colors placed side-by-side. The composition should feel spontaneous and immediate, prioritizing the artist's subjective perception of light and color over detailed rendering or narrative.","Evoke the sensory experience and atmosphere of the moment – the warmth of sunlight, the vibrancy of colors, the movement of air, the energy of modern life. Convey feelings of immediacy, spontaneity, and visual delight. The aim is often to capture a fleeting feeling of joy, tranquility, or the simple beauty perceived in a transient instant."
16,Post-Impressionism,~1886 CE–1905 CE,Vincent van Gogh,Starry Night (Oil Painting),"Search for lasting form and deeper meaning beyond Impressionism, need to express the inner world.","Search for Structure and Form, Emotional Expression, Symbolism, Inner Reality, Personal Style.","Use the Post-Impressionism style characterized by diverse, individualized approaches that move beyond capturing fleeting impressions. Emphasize structure, personal expression, symbolism, or form depending on the approach. Styles may include geometric structure building (Cézanne), emotional intensity through bold brushwork and color (Van Gogh), symbolic and non-naturalistic color usage (Gauguin), or scientific color theories like Pointillism (Seurat). Forms may appear simplified, flattened, or dynamically fragmented. Color palettes vary widely: intense yellows, blues, and greens (Van Gogh); rich reds, pinks, and symbolic hues (Gauguin); structural greens, ochres, blues (Cézanne); or pure color dots across the spectrum (Seurat). Brushwork and surface textures are highly varied — from thick impasto to meticulous dotting.","Render in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using flat or naturalistic lighting, depending on stylistic intention. Allow flexible composition strategies: structured and geometric, dynamically swirling, formally ordered, or decoratively flat. Accept expressive brushwork, visible paint textures, color contrasts, and structural or emotional exaggerations based on artistic choice. Avoid strict realism or photographic perspectives — instead focus on personal interpretation of form, color, and emotion to define the scene's visual and emotional impact.","Visualize a landscape or still life, like one by Cézanne, where forms are simplified into underlying geometric shapes (cylinders, spheres, cones) and built up with structured patches of color. Alternatively, depict a scene by Van Gogh using swirling, energetic brushstrokes and intense, emotionally charged colors that convey the artist's inner state rather than just visual appearance. The emphasis is on structure, personal expression, symbolism, or emotional intensity, moving beyond the Impressionists' focus on fleeting light.","Evoke a deeper emotional response or intellectual engagement than Impressionism. Depending on the artist, the aim might be to convey order and permanence (Cézanne), intense personal feeling and spiritual searching (Van Gogh), symbolic meaning (Gauguin), or structured scientific observation (Seurat). Capture the artist's subjective experience and interpretation of reality."
17,Fauvism,~1905 CE–1908 CE,Henri Matisse,The Joy of Life (Le bonheur de vivre) (Oil Painting),"Color freeing itself from representation to become an autonomous means of expression, rebellion against academic rules.","Autonomy/Arbitrariness of Color, Instinctual Energy, Joy of Life, Decorative Surface.","Use the Fauvism style, characterized by intense, arbitrary, non-naturalistic use of color to express emotion and structure. Apply bold, pure, unmixed colors directly to the canvas, with strong contrasts and unexpected color choices (e.g., green skies, orange animals). Forms should be simplified and abstracted, with flattened perspective and energetic, spontaneous brushwork. Surface pattern and color planes should dominate the composition rather than realistic depth. Strong outlines may separate areas of vivid color. The overall feeling should be joyful, vibrant, and expressive, favoring raw energy over realism.","Render the image in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using flat, even, bright lighting without realistic shadows. Use a direct, straight-on view emphasizing the two-dimensional surface and bold color zones. Avoid realistic perspective, atmospheric depth, shading, or blending. Focus on strong outlines, flat application of vivid colors, and dynamic arrangement of color fields. Brushstrokes should remain visible and energetic, celebrating the materiality of paint and the spontaneity of the moment.","Depict a landscape or portrait using bold, vibrant, non-naturalistic colors applied with energetic, often unblended brushstrokes. Imagine a scene like Derain's views of London or Matisse's portraits where color is liberated from description – skies might be orange, faces green – used purely for its expressive and decorative power. Simplify forms and flatten space to emphasize the impact of color harmonies and dissonances.","Evoke feelings of exuberance, joy, energy, and sensory intensity through the powerful use of color. Aim for a direct, instinctual emotional impact rather than nuanced psychological portrayal. Convey the artist's subjective feeling and excitement about the subject, celebrating the visual pleasure of pure, intense color and spontaneous execution."
18,Expressionism,~1905 CE–1920 CE,Edvard Munch,The Scream (Oil/Pastel/Tempera),"Spiritual turmoil created by the modern world, individual's loneliness and fears, striking inner truth.","Inner Anguish/Anxiety, Alienation, Psychological Depth, Social Criticism, Deformation.","Apply the Expressionism style, focusing on expressing intense subjective emotions rather than objective reality. Distort forms, colors, and space to maximize emotional impact. Use bold, jarring, and non-naturalistic colors, with vigorous, agitated brushwork. Figures should appear simplified, primitive, mask-like, or distorted, emphasizing psychological intensity over anatomical accuracy. Composition should reject traditional balance and embrace dynamic, uneasy, or claustrophobic arrangements with sharp diagonals and compressed space. Surface textures should be raw, energetic, and expressive, inspired by techniques like thick impasto or woodcut-like gouged effects.","Render the artwork in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting and no realistic shadows. Use a direct, straight-on perspective without complex angles or atmospheric depth. Focus on strong outlines, intense color contrasts, distorted forms, and emotionally charged arrangements. Avoid realistic perspective, smooth blending, or anatomical correctness. Let visible, rough brushstrokes or raw textures enhance the emotional immediacy and unease of the scene.","Visualize a scene reflecting intense inner turmoil, anxiety, or spirituality, like Munch's ""The Scream"" or Kirchner's street scenes. Utilize distorted forms, agitated brushwork, and jarring, non-naturalistic colors to convey subjective experience and psychological tension. The focus is on representing the artist's inner emotional reality rather than the external world's appearance.","Evoke strong, often uncomfortable emotions such as anxiety, fear, alienation, spiritual angst, or intense psychological states. Aim to directly communicate the artist's inner world and provoke an empathetic or visceral response in the viewer. Confront the emotional turbulence and spiritual condition of modern life."
19,Cubism,~1907 CE–1914 CE,Pablo Picasso,Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (Oil Painting),"Inadequacy of traditional representation, changing perception of time-space, fragmented nature of perception.","Multiple Viewpoints, Fragmented Form, Time-Space Perception, Abstraction, Analysis of the Object.","Apply the Cubism style by depicting the subject through multiple simultaneous viewpoints. Fragment objects and figures into geometric facets and overlapping planes, merging background and foreground into a flattened or ambiguous space. Emphasize structure, form, and analysis rather than realistic depiction. For Analytical Cubism, use a near-monochromatic palette (browns, greys, ochres, black, off-white) with intricate faceted textures. For Synthetic Cubism, introduce brighter flat colors (reds, blues, greens, yellows) and consider incorporating collage elements. Prioritize geometric abstraction, layered space, and the breakdown of single-point perspective.","Render the artwork in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting, avoiding shadows or naturalistic light sources. Maintain a direct, straight-on view to emphasize the two-dimensional surface. Construct complex, layered compositions for Analytical Cubism, or use simpler, flatter color planes with possible textural contrasts for Synthetic Cubism. Avoid traditional realistic perspective, smooth blending, or volumetric shading. Focus on conveying form through intersecting planes, fragmented space, and flattened depth.","Depict a familiar object, like a guitar or a face, simultaneously from multiple viewpoints, breaking it down into fragmented geometric planes and facets. Overlap these planes on a flattened picture surface, abandoning traditional perspective. In early (Analytical) Cubism, use a restricted, monochromatic palette (browns, grays) to focus on structure. In later (Synthetic) Cubism, reintroduce color and incorporate elements of collage (like newspaper text).","Primarily stimulate intellectual engagement and challenge traditional ways of seeing and representing reality. Evoke a sense of complexity, fragmentation, simultaneity, and the analytical process of perception. The emotional impact is generally subdued, focusing more on formal innovation and the redefinition of pictorial space."
20,Futurism,~1909 CE–1944 CE,Umberto Boccioni,The City Rises (Oil Painting),"Intoxication of technological progress, rejection of old values, worship of speed and machines.","Speed and Dynamism, Machine Aesthetics, Worship of Modernity, Destruction of the Past, Violence.","Apply the Futurism style by celebrating motion, dynamism, speed, and modern energy. Depict objects and figures in motion through fragmentation, repeated outlines, directional lines of force, and energetic brushstrokes. Incorporate multiple sequential stages of movement into a single image to convey simultaneity. Use a vibrant, high-key color palette influenced by Divisionism, with bright reds, oranges, yellows, strong blues, and dynamic greens, creating vivid contrasts. Emphasize the sensation of speed and chaotic energy, rejecting traditional static composition and embracing fractured, kinetic forms.","Render the artwork in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting, avoiding naturalistic light sources or shadows. Use a straight-on view to maintain surface dynamism without traditional perspective depth. Construct highly dynamic compositions dominated by diagonals, repeated forms, interpenetrating planes, and broken, vibrant color areas. Prioritize the energetic, fragmented sensation of movement and technological energy rather than realism or stability.","Visualize the dynamic sensation of speed and movement, perhaps depicting a speeding car, train, or cyclist using fragmented forms, rhythmic repetition, and ""lines of force"" that suggest motion blur and trajectory. Embrace themes of technology, urban energy, and the machine age. Use bright, vibrant colors and compositions that convey dynamism, energy, and the simultaneous experiences of modern life.","Evoke feelings of excitement, energy, dynamism, speed, and the power of technology. Celebrate the sensory overload and relentless motion of the modern world. Aim to capture the thrill, sometimes bordering on aggression or violence, associated with machines, urban life, and a radical break from the past."
21,Dadaism,1916 CE–1924 CE,Marcel Duchamp,"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (Oil Painting)","Loss of meaning created by war, bankruptcy of bourgeois values, desire to break the boundaries of art.","Meaninglessness/Absurdity, Rebellion and Provocation, Randomness, Anti-Art, Rejection of Logic.","Apply the Dadaism style by embracing absurdity, irrationality, and chance. Construct the scene with intentional fragmentation, jarring juxtapositions, and a rejection of traditional aesthetic norms. Incorporate mixed media elements such as simulated collages, photomontages, or assemblages, using found imagery, random typography, or disparate materials. Allow randomness or deliberate anti-aesthetic choices to drive the composition. Colors should derive from the textures and tones of source materials like newsprint, sepia photographs, labels, and clashing random additions rather than following a harmonious palette.","Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using flat, even lighting without directional shadows. Present the scene with a fragmented, chaotic structure that avoids conventional balance, perspective, or focal hierarchy. Simulate the texture of layered paper, torn materials, printed photographs, or rough assemblages. Encourage visual disruption, randomness, and playful anti-order while emphasizing the tactile feel of found and layered textures.","Visualize a nonsensical assemblage or collage combining found objects, fragmented text from newspapers, and machine parts, perhaps alongside a deliberately defaced reproduction of a famous artwork. The composition should feel random, chaotic, and provocative, rejecting traditional aesthetics and rational structure. It could also be a performance featuring simultaneous nonsensical poems or bizarre costumes, designed to challenge and disrupt audience expectations.","Evoke feelings of absurdity, disorientation, humor, irony, or outrage. Aim to shock the viewer out of conventional thinking and complacency. Convey a deep critique of war, nationalism, and bourgeois values through irrationality and anti-art gestures, reflecting disillusionment and a desire to dismantle established norms."
22,Surrealism,~1924 CE–1950s CE,Salvador Dalí,The Persistence of Memory (Melting Clocks) (Oil Painting),"Escaping the oppression of reason, exploring suppressed desires and the subconscious, limits of reality.","Unconscious and Dreams, The Irrational/Illogical, Automatism, Desire and Instincts, Revolutionary Spirit.","Apply the Surrealist style by exploring dreams, the unconscious, and irrational juxtapositions. Create scenes populated with bizarre, unrelated elements placed in unexpected and illogical contexts. Emphasize either hyperrealistic, meticulously detailed rendering to heighten the dreamlike strangeness (Veristic Surrealism) or abstract, biomorphic forms generated through automatism and subconscious techniques (Abstract Surrealism). Incorporate surprising scale distortions, metamorphosis, organic abstractions, and psychological symbolism. Use either smooth, polished textures for detailed works or free, spontaneous surface treatments for abstract expressions.","Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using soft, dreamlike lighting or a flat, ambient glow without clear directional shadows. Compose the scene with illogical spatial arrangements, deep or ambiguous perspective, or free-floating elements in undefined environments. Simulate either smooth, highly finished textures or expressive, textured effects like frottage or grattage depending on the sub-style. Prioritize surreal atmospheres, uncanny details, and emotionally charged or subconscious-driven associations over rational structure or traditional realism.","Depict a dreamlike landscape where familiar objects are juxtaposed in illogical ways, such as melting clocks in a desert (Dalí) or a train emerging from a fireplace (Magritte). Utilize realistic, detailed painting techniques to make the impossible seem believable. Alternatively, use automatic drawing or painting techniques to create biomorphic, abstract shapes that seem to emerge directly from the subconscious mind without rational control.","Evoke a sense of mystery, wonder, the uncanny, psychological unease, or liberation from rational constraints. Tap into the viewer's subconscious, stirring hidden desires, fears, or associations. Create a feeling of exploring the bizarre and fascinating landscape of dreams and the irrational mind."
23,Abstract Expressionism,~1940s CE–1960 CE,Jackson Pollock,"No. 5, 1948 (Drip Technique/Oil Painting)","Post-war trauma and search for meaning, individual's existential struggle, expression of the subconscious.","Existential Anxiety, Abstract Expression, Action and Gesture, Individual Mythology, Spontaneity.","Apply the Abstract Expressionist style, emphasizing non-representational imagery created through spontaneous, gestural, and emotionally charged techniques. Explore two major approaches: Action Painting, which focuses on vigorous, physical mark-making like dripping, splashing, and impasto layers; and Color Field Painting, which emphasizes expansive, contemplative areas of luminous or somber color. Prioritize the artist's internal emotions, psychological states, or mythic concepts over narrative or recognizable forms. Use either highly textured, energetic surfaces (Action Painting) or large, soft-edged color planes (Color Field Painting) to evoke sublimity and transcendence.","Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting that does not create naturalistic shadows. Compose the scene either as an 'all-over' energetic surface without clear focal points (Action Painting) or with simplified, large color fields (Color Field Painting). Emphasize the material presence of the paint, surface variations, and dynamic or meditative energy. Avoid realistic spatial depth, traditional perspective, and detailed figure depiction. The focus should remain on abstract emotional resonance through process and pure visual experience.","Visualize a large canvas covered in dynamic, energetic drips and splatters of paint (like Pollock's Action Painting), emphasizing the physical process and spontaneous gesture. Alternatively, imagine vast fields of luminous, contemplative color that seem to envelop the viewer (like Rothko's Color Field painting). The work should be non-representational, focusing on the expressive qualities of paint, color, texture, and scale.","Evoke powerful, direct emotional or spiritual responses through abstract means. Action Painting might convey energy, anxiety, chaos, or raw feeling. Color Field painting might inspire awe, transcendence, introspection, or profound calm. The aim is often an immersive, personal encounter with the artwork's emotional presence."
24,Pop Art,~1955 CE–1970s CE,Andy Warhol,Campbell's Soup Cans (Screenprint/Polymer Paint),"Dominance of consumer culture, blurring of high/low art distinction, power of media.","Mass Culture/Popular Images, Consumer Society, Irony and Superficiality, Mass Production/Repetition.","Apply the Pop Art style, incorporating imagery and aesthetics from mass media, advertising, comic books, and consumer culture. Use bold outlines, flat, bright color areas, and a mechanical or impersonal aesthetic. Emphasize recognizable subjects in a clean, commercial-like finish, minimizing visible brushwork. Techniques may include silkscreen simulation, Ben-Day dots, flat acrylic painting, stenciling, and collage elements sourced from popular media. The mood can be ironic, humorous, critical, or celebratory, but compositions should be direct, iconic, and easily readable.","Render the artwork in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, bright, even lighting and no visible shadows. Use a straight-on, clear camera view with centralized, bold compositions reminiscent of advertisement layouts or comic panels. Maintain strong black outlines, flat, unmodulated colors, and smooth, polished surfaces without texture or painterly effects. Avoid atmospheric depth, realistic shading, or visible brushstrokes. Prefer clean, sharp visual elements that mimic the look of printed materials and pop culture artifacts.","Depict an everyday consumer object, like a soup can or soda bottle, or a celebrity icon, like Marilyn Monroe, using techniques borrowed from commercial art (bold colors, flat surfaces, screen printing). Often uses repetition or large scale to mimic mass production and advertising. The style should be clean, graphic, and immediately recognizable, referencing popular culture directly.","Evoke feelings associated with popular culture and consumerism – familiarity, nostalgia, fascination with celebrity, desire, or perhaps irony and detachment. Blur the lines between ""high"" art and everyday life, prompting reflection on mass media, commercialism, and the icons of contemporary society, often with a cool, ambiguous attitude."
25,Minimalism,~1960 CE–1975 CE,Frank Stella,Die Fahne Hoch! (Shaped Canvas/Enamel Paint),"Rejection of subjective expression in art, focus on the object's physical presence, viewer experience.","Objectivity/Objecthood, Simplicity and Reduction, Industrial Materials, Perceptual Experience.","Apply the Minimalism style, emphasizing extreme simplicity of form through basic geometric shapes such as cubes, squares, lines, and grids. Maintain a non-representational, non-referential, and objective aesthetic. Focus on industrial materials (like polished steel, plexiglass, raw wood) or monochromatic geometric painting with precise, flat application. Remove any visible traces of the artist's hand, ensuring an impersonal and fabricated appearance. Use repetition, serial structures, and systematic arrangements without expressive gesture, ornamentation, or complex compositions.","Render the artwork in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using flat, bright, and even lighting with no discernible shadows. Maintain a strict, straight-on camera view, emphasizing the physical presence, geometry, and materiality of the forms. Avoid traditional depth, realistic perspective, dynamic poses, or textured brushwork. Surfaces should appear industrially fabricated — smooth, uniform, and devoid of expressive marks — highlighting symmetry, seriality, and simplicity within the overall composition.","Visualize a simple, geometric form, like a cube or a series of identical rectangular boxes, made from industrial materials (e.g., steel, plexiglass). Place it directly on the floor or wall without a pedestal. The work should be devoid of ornamentation, figuration, or evidence of the artist's hand. Emphasize the object's literal presence, its material qualities, and its relationship to the surrounding space and the viewer.","Promote a direct, unmediated perceptual experience of the object and space. Aim for objectivity and neutrality, shifting focus away from the artist's emotion to the viewer's own awareness and physical encounter with the work. Can induce feelings of calmness, clarity, order, or presence through simplicity and reduction of visual noise."
26,Conceptual Art,~1965 CE–1975 CE,Joseph Kosuth,One and Three Chairs (Installation/Idea - not painting),"Question of what constitutes an artwork, primacy of the idea over the object, role of art institutions.","Primacy of Idea/Concept, Definition/Limits of Art, Language and Text, Dematerialization.","Apply the Conceptual Art style, prioritizing the idea or concept over traditional aesthetic or material qualities. Visual form should be secondary and functional, appearing dematerialized or minimal. Manifestations can include text-based works (instructions, definitions, statements), documentary-style photography (often black and white), diagrams, maps, or process documentation. Reject traditional notions of skill, beauty, and handcrafted objects. Focus instead on intellectual clarity, system-based logic, and the use of language or predefined frameworks.","Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) using flat, even, neutral lighting with no discernible source or shadows. Maintain a strict, straight-on camera view, avoiding dynamic angles or compositional flourishes. Surface and material textures should be minimal and functional, such as the smoothness of a print or the flatness of typed text. Visuals should emphasize clarity, information structure, or conceptual austerity, avoiding expressive brushstrokes, dramatic color usage, or aesthetic embellishment.","Present the artwork primarily as an idea, which might be communicated through text, instructions, photographs, maps, or documentation rather than a traditional aesthetic object. For example, visualize Joseph Kosuth's ""One and Three Chairs"" (an actual chair, a photograph of the chair, and a dictionary definition of ""chair""). The focus is on the thought process, definition, or concept itself, often questioning the nature of art and its institutions.","Prioritize intellectual engagement, questioning, and critical thinking over direct emotional response. Aim to provoke thought about the definition of art, language, meaning, and context. Any emotional impact often arises from contemplating the idea presented or the critique implied, rather than from the visual form itself."
27,Postmodernism,~1970 CE–1990 CE,Gerhard Richter,Betty (Oil Painting),"Distrust of universal truths, reinterpretation of history and cultures, fluidity of identity.","Rejection of Grand Narratives, Fragmentation/Eclecticism, Irony/Pastiche/Parody, Identity Politics.","Apply the Postmodernism style, characterized by skepticism, irony, eclecticism, and the rejection of Modernist ideals like purity, originality, and universalism. Embrace complexity, contradiction, fragmentation, and humor. Techniques can include appropriation of existing images or styles, pastiche (stylistic imitation), collage, montage, installation, mixed media, and critical use of text. Surface and style may be slick, rough, kitschy, commercial, expressive, or historically referential depending on the strategy. There is no fixed visual language; emphasis is placed on commentary, subversion, and the construction of meaning.","Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, even, neutral lighting without a discernible source or shadows. Use a direct, straight-on camera view without dynamic angles. Composition should reflect the diverse, layered, or ironic sensibility of Postmodernism, possibly featuring appropriated elements, fragmented arrangements, or pastiche of historical styles. Texture, color, and medium choices are flexible and should serve the conceptual and critical stance of the artwork, rather than adhering to traditional aesthetic standards.","Visualize an artwork that intentionally mixes styles, references, or materials from different periods or cultural contexts (pastiche, appropriation). It might involve irony, parody, or humor, perhaps juxtaposing ""high art"" elements with imagery from popular culture or kitsch. The work might challenge notions of originality, authorship, or grand narratives, embracing fragmentation, complexity, and contradiction.","Evoke a sense of irony, playfulness, skepticism, or critical awareness. Challenge the viewer's assumptions about style, meaning, and value. Depending on the specific approach, it might elicit amusement, disorientation, nostalgia (via appropriation), or encourage a recognition of cultural complexity and the constructed nature of reality."
28,Contemporary Art,~1970 CE–Present,Refik Anadol,Machine Hallucinations (AI Data Sculpture/Digital Art - not painting),"Impact of technology on human life, virtual-real relationship, global issues, data overload.","Globalization, Digitalization/Cyber Culture, Network Society, Ecological Awareness, Identity and Technology.","Apply the Contemporary Art approach, characterized by extreme diversity, plurality, and the absence of a single dominant style or ideology. Embrace globalized perspectives, reflecting influences from technology, social media, environmental concerns, identity politics, activism, and interdisciplinary practices. Styles can range from hyperrealism to pure abstraction, minimalism to maximalism, conceptual to craft-based. Methods often blend traditional media with digital technologies, installation, performance, community engagement, and AI-assisted creation. Appropriation, irony, and hybridization of disciplines are common.","Render the work in a 4:3 aspect ratio (1536×1024 resolution) with flat, even lighting without strong shadows. Use a direct, straight-on camera view. The visual execution is fully context-dependent: it can be hyper-detailed or highly abstract, static or interactive, minimal or overflowing with detail. Textures, colors, and compositional strategies are determined entirely by the conceptual intent of the piece rather than by stylistic constraints. There are no prescriptive visual rules — every choice should serve the specific conceptual, emotional, or narrative focus of the artwork.","Represent an artwork reflecting current global issues, social concerns, or technological advancements, using any possible medium (installation, video, digital art, performance, traditional media employed in new ways). The work might engage with identity politics, environmental concerns, digital culture, or critique power structures. It should feel relevant to the present moment, potentially drawing on diverse artistic strategies and embracing hybridity.","Highly varied, reflecting the diversity of contemporary life itself. Can aim to provoke thought, foster empathy, incite social or political awareness, create sensory experiences, express personal identity, explore complex feelings (love, loss, anxiety, connection), or challenge the viewer's perspective on current realities. The emotional connection often stems from the relevance of the themes to lived experience today."
